- thoughts on check pattern language quotes:
		- Do not expect your domain model to handle string or numeric
		  representations of the same information.
		- Every clause of every statement should be motivated by some
		  business fact of life.
		- In your domain models you are chartered to express business logic
		  with no more complexity than originally conceived or currently
		  expressed.
		- A person reaches through a program's interface to manipulate the
		  domain model.

** From "Programming as Experience: The Inspiration of Self"
*** Randall B. Smith and David Ungar (1995)
     When there is only one way of doing things, it is easier to
     modify and reuse code. When code is reused, programs are easier
     to change and most importantly, shrink. When a program shrinks
     its construction and maintenance requires fewer people which
     allows for more opportunities for reuse to be found. Consistency
     leads to reuise, reuse leads to conciseness, conciseness leads to
     understanding.
