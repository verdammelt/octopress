    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/7076702975/" title="We arrived by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7262/7076702975_aa72f9797f_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="We arrived" /></a></div>

<p>We were going to see Kraftwerk at MoMA and the trip didn’t start well as we
sat in stop-and-go traffic through Connecticut right into NYC. Luckily we were
not driving ourselves, but I still worried this was an ill omen. We even had
trouble finding some quick food before the show.  Even with all these problems
the show was fantastic.</p>

<p>Wendy and I staked our claim to a bench off to the side and at the back while
the surprisingly young crowd filled in in front of the stage.  The view was
just fine from where we were.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930626360/" title="Before the Start by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5160/6930626360_52c08a0863_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Before the Start" /></a></div>

<p>The show began with the dropping of the curtain - showing the band at their
podiums.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930628196/" title="Man Machine by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7256/6930628196_f0e9f55d7d_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Man Machine" /></a></div>

<p>They started the album off by playing Man-Machine and with the 3d glasses the
visuals were interesting…  but when Spacelab started they were fantastic.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930629942/" title="Spacelab by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7245/6930629942_d14e740db0_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Spacelab" /></a></div>

<p>The images of Spacelab orbiting the earth was great. They even used a cheap 3d trick of having the
orbiting ship head straight into the audience; cheap but still fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/7076706387/" title="Spacelab by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7254/7076706387_c0350cb588_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Spacelab" /></a></p>

<p>The huge looming buildings, and slow pans through them fit with the song
Metropolis perfectly.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930631270/" title="Metropolis by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5322/6930631270_7e2b6fa0c7_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Metropolis" /></a></div>

<p>The visuals for The Model were all black-and-white fashion shots - not much
more interesting in ‘3d’ than not, but the next song (Neon Lights) used the 3d
effects better.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930632608/" title="Neon Lights by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7231/6930632608_bf42a511dc_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Neon Lights" /></a></div>

<p>The album performance was capped off with We are the Robots. Everyone went
wild over the robo-kraftwerk dancing and looming over the audience.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930633680/" title="We are the Robots by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/6930633680_f64f6eef0f_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="We are the Robots" /></a></div>

<p>Now that the album was over I was not sure what to expect; I was not
disappointed with their choice of Autobahn - the visuals being computer
generated VW Beetle and other cars on a seemingly infinite Autobahn. The song
ended with VW pulling off the highway.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930634846/" title="Autobahn by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7202/6930634846_dee3cd91e6_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Autobahn" /></a></div>

<p>Up next was Radioactivity followed by Trans Europe Express. Then ComputerWorld
and Tour De France.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930638504/" title="Tour de France by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7214/6930638504_30f5ed2ac2_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Tour de France" /></a></div>

<p>Then my phone battery died - so not more pictures. So you’ll have to take my
word on it that the rest of the show, including Technopop was fantastic.</p>
