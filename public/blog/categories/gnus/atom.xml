    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An addendum to follow up on how to fix an item that was giving me a
problem before.</p>

<p>In order to get ham &amp; spam moved and processed as such when you mark it
you need to set up additional group parameters:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>'((&quot;nnfolder.*&quot;
 (spam-contents gnus-group-spam-classification-ham)
 (spam-process (ham spam-use-bogofilter)
           (spam spam-use-bogofilter))
 (spam-process-destination &quot;nnfolder:spam.spam&quot;))
(&quot;spam.spam&quot;
 (spam-contents gnus-group-spam-classification-spam)
 (spam-process (spam spam-use-bogofilter)
           (ham spam-use-bogofilter))
 (ham-process-destination &quot;nnfolder:mail.misc&quot;))</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Specifically the <code>spam-process-destination</code> and
<code>ham-process-destination</code> pair.  These cause the mail to be moved from
the ham to spam groups and /visa versa/.</p>

<p>One problem still remains &ndash; the bogofilter still doesn&rsquo;t seem to be
doing anything.  I don&rsquo;t see any evidence that it is being called in the
`<em>Messages</em> buffer either.</p>

<p>So the score is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bogofilter not being called when groups exited</li>
<li>Wish I could get BBDB to work.</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Setting up Splitting</h2>

<p>The next thing I felt I needed to set up was spam splitting.  I didn&rsquo;t
want obvious spam being dumped into my inbox anymore.</p>

<p>To set up spam splitting you need to be using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy
Splitting</a>.  Then you add <code>(: spam-split)</code> to you fancy split
rules. At this point you have something like:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(setq nnmail-split-methods 'nnmail-split-fancy
         nnmail-split-fancy '(| (: spam-split)
                                &quot;mail.misc&quot;))</pre></div>
</div>

<p>You also have to call <code>spam-initialize</code> to make it start working.</p>

<p>/However/ one has to do a little more.  You have to specify which spam
back ends you want to use.  Since my <a href="http://theworld.com/">ISP</a> runs
<a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a> I chose to use
<code>spam-use-spamassassin-headers</code>.  Setting this to <code>t</code> makes the spam
package check for the <code>X-Spam-Status: YES</code> header.  (There are plenty of
choices so check out the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Spam-Back-Ends.html#Spam-Back-Ends">doc</a>)</p>

<h2>What didn&rsquo;t work quite right</h2>

<p>I also wanted to use <a href="http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/">Bogofilter</a> so that my local machine
could learn to identify stuff that my upstream Spamassassin did not.
However I&rsquo;m not sure if that is working correctly.  My Bogofilter
database file is still zero size.</p>

<p>To get a spam back end to process spam and ham when you are done reading
a group you need to add some group parameters.  So I set:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(setq gnus-parameters
       '((&quot;nnfolder.*&quot;
          (spam-contents gnus-group-spam-classification-ham)
          (spam-process (ham spam-use-bogofilter)))
         (&quot;spam.spam&quot;
          (spam-contents gnus-group-spam-classification-spam)
          (spam-process (spam spam-use-bogofilter)))
        ...</pre></div>
</div>

<p>But like I said that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be working.  I&rsquo;m probably just
missing something small that is mentioned in the documentation.</p>

<h2>What seems to be broken</h2>

<p>Before my nuke and pave (and upgrade to emacs v24) I was using
<a href="http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/">BBDB</a> as a whitelist.  So if you were not in my BBDB then you
went to spam.  However with v24 when I try to use BBDB I get an error
saying that <code>bbdb-search</code> is undefined.  It /is/ defined in
<code>bbdb-com.el</code> however so I am not sure what is wrong.  I&rsquo;m going to
investigate a bit more and post a question on <code>gmane.emacs.gnus.general</code>
and <code>gmane.emacs.gnus.user</code> (maybe also <code>gmane.emacs.bbdb.user</code>).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&hellip;you just need to nuke-and-pave your configuration.</p>

<p>That time has come for me &ndash; especially with respect to my <a href="http://gnus.org">GNUS</a>
configuration. I&rsquo;ve been using GNUS to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">news</a> since
probably 1990 or earlier, before then I remember using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rn_(newsreader)">rn</a>.</p>

<p>As for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email">email</a> I&rsquo;ve used <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Rmail">RMAIL</a> and <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryViewMail">VM</a>.  I don&rsquo;t
remember exactly when I switched GNUS but it has been probably at least
5 years.</p>

<p>Over that time my <a href="http://www.gnus.org/manual/gnus_11.html#SEC11">gnus init file</a> has grown pretty hairy.
It is time for a shave.</p>

<p>Over the last week I&rsquo;ve switched to a pretest release of Emacs v24 and
during that time I cleaned out a lot of configuration &ndash; but feared to clean out
much of my gnus configuration.  However in trying to get the spam checking
working better I realized that a nuke-and-pave is probably the best
thing to do now.</p>

<p>So I am about to remove nearly ALL of my gnus configuration.  Pray for me.</p>

<p>p.s. I&rsquo;ll try to blog about my luck or lack-there-of.  And also any
interesting bits I discover along the way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So far I have flailed around moving my email to a different structure.
I have been using <code>nnmail-use-long-file-names</code> set to <code>t</code> up until now.
But I decided to try it out with the default value of <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>I had several problems this evening</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sent mail was going to <code>nnfolder+nnfolder</code> instead of
<code>nnfolder+archive</code> as advertised.  I think that this may have been
caused by old settings in my <code>.newsrc.eld</code>.  After mucking about in
there I started getting my sent mail in the right place.</p></li>
<li><p>Not sure how it happened but the system acted as if
<code>nnfolder-directory</code> was set to <code>~/News/nnfolder</code> but then suddenly
switched to <code>~/Mail/</code>.  I got that all sorted out (now set to
<code>~/News/mail</code>) but it took some time and my brain didn&rsquo;t figure out
how it was working for while.  The important part here is if you move
a mail file you must also move/edit the <code>active</code> file to list that
mail group.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the problems may have been caused by a rather cavalier attitude
to the task.  If I had sat down to do it more carefully and slowly it
could have gone more smoothly.</p>

<p>No mail was lost so I am happy. But the system as it is currently
configured is definitely not the way I want to keep it.  Things to do
next:</p>

<ul>
<li>spam handling</li>
<li>expiry for archving (which I conflate that with sent mail processing)</li>
<li>splitting (but less splitting than I was doing previously)</li>
</ul>

<p>But now&hellip; time for sleep.</p>
