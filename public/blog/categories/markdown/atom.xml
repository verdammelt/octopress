    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have had some annoying problems recently making <a href="http://posterous.com">posterous</a>
blog posts via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email">email</a> using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>.</p>

<p>These problems have made me feel foolish - like I can’t get something
/simple/ right.  Or even more importantly, like I am incapable of simple
copy editing.</p>

<p>Thus I am writing this test blog post.</p>

<p>However, not wanting to write a post saying:</p>

<p>&gt; testing testing - please ignore</p>

<p>Instead I will mumble something about <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> and muse on how it would be
sort of cool if I could write each post as a LaTeX document and then
they’d look pretty gorgeous.  Not that I need lots of equations - but
really LaTeX would do it so perfectly. <img src="http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/creating_plots/latex_equations.png" alt="isn't it
lovely" title="a lovely set of equations" /></p>

<p>Perhaps my biggest problem is that I can’t easily get a nice preview.  I
am editing this in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">Emacs</a> using <a href="http://www.gnus.org/">Gnus</a>.  Really given that
it is Emacs there may already be a solution to my problems - or I could
do it myself.</p>

<p>But getting back to LaTeX blogging.  What might that look like?  Perhaps
each post would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdf">PDF</a>?  Or maybe the LaTeX document would be
rendered as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html">HTML</a>?  Perhaps this deserves a little more thinking.</p>

<p>Time to send this off and see how screwed up it looks in <a href="http://verdammelt.posterous.com">my
posterous</a>.</p>
