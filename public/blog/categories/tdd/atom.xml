<p>What’s a person to do when one prefers developing in a TDD style and
decides to start a project where nothing not directly in the language
needs to be written? Why, write a testing library of course! But…
without a testing library how can one write this testing library in a
TDD fashion? Herein is how I went about doing it.</p>

<p>(Full disclosure: this is not the first time I’ve tried this sort
thing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. But I had forgotten I had done it before until I was
writing this article.)</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first
invent the universe.” – Carl Sagan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have decided to have a crazy project wherein I’ll write an
application in Common Lisp and <em>only</em> Common Lisp. That is to say, no
other libraries. I have allowed myself to use extensions provided by
the the implementation SBCL<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> so luckily I won’t need to write my
own socket and threading extensions.</p>

<p>This is a crazy and stupid idea. But the point of the project is to
give me a place to play around with things I don’t normally deal with
and in a language that I like to play with.</p>

<h2 id="test-driving-a-testing-library">Test Driving a Testing Library</h2>

<h3 id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h3>

<p>Common Lisp has no built in testing library, but it does have
<code>assert</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. If you have <code>assert</code> you can write a testing library.
The problem is writing the first test. I puzzled it over a little and
decided I’d need a function which would take an expression to evaluate
(the test) and would return some data structure which would indicate
the results of the test. Given that here is the first test:</p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(assert (assoc :failure (test::collect-test-results (assert nil))))
</code></pre>

<p>So this is asserting that the return value of <code>collect-test-results</code>
when applied to <code>(assert nil)</code> will be an alist<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> which will
have a <code>cons</code> cell whose <code>car</code> is <code>:failure</code>.</p>

<p>This test directly implies the following test:</p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(assert (not (assoc :failure (test::collect-test-results (assert t)))))
</code></pre>

<p>That is to say: if the expression does not raise an exception there
will <em>not</em> be such an element in the returned alist.</p>

<p>After implementing a macro which lets those test pass I wrote some
more tests to round out what I thought would be a useful implmentation
of this base function of the library. I now had these tests to
bootstrap my library.</p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(assert (assoc :failure (test::collect-test-results (assert nil))))
(assert (not (assoc :failure (test::collect-test-results (assert t)))))
(assert (equal (assoc :value (test::collect-test-results 'foo)) '(:value . foo)))
(assert (assoc :duration (test::collect-test-results 'foo)))
(assert (assoc :start (test::collect-test-results 'foo)))
(assert (assoc :end (test::collect-test-results 'foo)))
(format t "~A...PASSED~&amp;" 'test::collect-test-results)
</code></pre>

<p>With this I felt that I had enough testing to make me feel confident
in my little implementation. It wasn’t perfect - but good enough for
me to now <em>use</em> this function to test other parts of my library.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-write-a-test">How to write a test</h3>

<p>With <code>collect-test-results</code> I had a way to writing and running
individual simple tests. But it wasn’t a very convenient thing to use.
But what it let me do is now write tests for <code>deftest</code> which would let
me define tests. I started by writing the sort of test I wanted to
write:</p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(deftest a-simple-failing-test
    "This is a very simple test which fails"
  (assert (= 5 (+ 2 2))))
</code></pre>

<p>Through a few tests, written using <code>collect-test-results</code> I determined
that <code>deftest</code> would intern a symbol with the same name as the first
argument of the <code>deftest</code>, bind its function property to a function
which when called would, by calling <code>collect-test-results</code> evaluate
the body of the <code>deftest</code>. These symbols were put into a list which
could be retrieved from the library. Furthermore, defining a test with
the same name as an existing test does not create a duplicate test.</p>

<p>It might be clearest to just show you how these tests (and an
extracted helper function) ended up:</p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(defmacro assert-no-failure (&amp;body assertion)
  (let ((failure (gensym "fail")))
    `(let ((,failure (assoc :failure (test::collect-test-results
                                       (assert ,@assertion)))))
       (assert (not ,failure) () (format nil "~A" ,failure)))))

(deftest a-simple-failing-test
    "This is a very simple test which fails"
  (assert (= 5 (+ 2 2))))

(let ((test-list (test::test-list)))
  (assert-no-failure (equal test-list '(a-simple-failing-test)))
  (assert-no-failure (fboundp (car test-list)))
  (assert-no-failure (assoc :failure (funcall (car test-list))))
  (assert-no-failure (string= "This is a very simple test which fails"
                              (documentation (car test-list) 'function)))
  (assert-no-failure (equal (assoc :test-name (funcall (car test-list)))
                            '(:test-name . test-test::a-simple-failing-test))))

(deftest a-simple-failing-test
    "This is a very simple test which fails"
  (assert (= 5 (+ 2 2))))

(assert-no-failure (= (length (test::test-list)) 1))

(deftest a-simple-passing-test
    "This is a very simple test which passes"
  (assert (= 4 (+ 2 2))))

(assert-no-failure (= (length (test::test-list)) 2))

(format t "~A...PASSED~&amp;" 'test:deftest)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="running-tests">Running tests</h3>

<p>Now that we can define tests and evaluate them all that is left is to
have a convenient way to run the defined tests. Three quick tests on
the output of <code>run-all-tests</code> were proof enough for me (the tests that the
call to <code>run-all-tests</code> would run were the ones defined above, one
passing and one failing) that it would execute each test, report which
ones failed and a count of passes and fails to <code>*standard-output*</code>.:</p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(let ((*standard-output* (make-string-output-stream)))
  (run-all-tests)
  (let ((output (get-output-stream-string *standard-output*)))
    (assert-no-failure (search "A-SIMPLE-FAILING-TEST...FAILED." output))
    (assert-no-failure (search "PASSED: 1" output))
    (assert-no-failure (search "FAILED: 1" output))))
(format t "~A...PASSED~&amp;" 'test:run-all-tests)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>

<p>At this point my testing library has two main entry points: <code>deftest</code>
and <code>run-all-tests</code>. To create them, I first used <code>assert</code> to test
drive the creation on a lower-level function <code>collect-test-results</code>,
which I then used to test drive <code>deftest</code>, which I then used to test
drive <code>run-all-tests</code>.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps-and-thoughts">Next Steps and Thoughts</h2>

<p>Now that I have this testing library I can use it to test drive the
rest of the application I will write. I’m sure along the way I’ll be
extending this library as I find new requirements for it. I’ll
probably also be writing some assertion library to make the tests more
expressive.</p>

<p>The resulting tests<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> and code<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> are in my GitHub repository for this
project: yakshave<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While avoiding family this Christmas-day I started trying to figure out way
for me to do TDD in Common Lisp (as one does…). That led to SLIME<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and
    QuickLisp<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and lisp-unit<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> and asdf<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> (<em>&amp;c. &amp;c</em>).</p>

<h2 id="its-yaks-the-whole-way-down">…it’s yaks the whole way down.</h2>

<p>The hardest part for me was to find a simple way to load my code and run the
tests. ASDF ships with <code>asdf:test-system</code> defined but it does nothing by
default<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. So I did some digging around and saw some other’s solutions and
synthesized my version.</p>

<p>Here is an example ASDF system definition for a Game of Life<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>

<h2 id="my-god-its-full-of-yaks">My God… it’s full of yaks</h2>

<p>I’m just going to let that sink in for a bit while I get some coffee.</p>

<p>Ok, now that I’m back I will explain each part. The first interesting bit is
on line 6:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>depends-on </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This line tells ASDF that it should find and load a system called <code>lisp-unit</code>
because our system depends upon it. This is where QuickLisp makes things
simple since that is its job and it does a fine one at that.</p>

<p>Next is the definition of our components:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>I’ve decided that my project should have two main directories, one to contain
all the production source code and one for all the test source code. Each one
will be in their own packages, with the <code>:gol-test</code> package <code>:use</code>-ing the
<code>:gol</code> package. <code>:serial t</code> by the way tells ASDF that each item in the
component list depends upon the one before it.</p>

<p>Now the hairier parts which tell ASDF to run our tests:</p>

<p>The first line is simply stating that in order to do <code>test-op</code> ASDF needs to
perform <code>load-op</code> on the <code>:gol</code> system. This way every time we run the tests
we’ll reload the system if needed.</p>

<p>Now… this next bit probably shows how rusty my Lisp is. Maybe there is an
easier way. Basically we want to run <code>(lisp-unit:run-tests :all :gol-test)</code>
with <code>lisp-unit:*print-errors*</code> and <code>lisp-unit:*print-failures*</code> both bound to
<code>t</code> (they default to <code>nil</code> and that doesn’t give enough info IMNSHO). However
when Lisp is reading and evaluating this code <code>lisp-unit</code> has probably not yet
been loaded - so we have to be crafty and find the symbol by name in the
package then <code>funcall</code> it. Binding the variables was trickier but I stumbled
upon <code>progv</code><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> and that seems to be just what I needed.</p>

<p><code>progv</code> creates new dynamic bindings for the symbols in the list which is its
first argument. These symbols are determined at runtime. That means we can use
<code>intern</code> to find or create these symbols in the right package<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup>. <code>progv</code>
binds these symbols to the values in the list which is its second parameter
and then finally executes the sexp which is its third argument in an
environment which contains these new bindings.</p>

<p>With this work done I can now type in <code>(asdf:test-system 'gol)</code> into my REPL
and it loads and runs my tests and gives me useful output of those tests. I
might go so far as to bind that to a very short function name, or even a key
in Emacs.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-still-more-yaks-to-shave">There are still more yaks to shave.</h2>

<p>What is left to be determined is if this is the best way to do things.</p>

<p>Some documentation/blogs I read lead me to believe that putting the tests in
the same system with the production code is <em>verboten</em> (or at least a
<em>no-no</em>). I tried having the tests be in their own system definition
(depending upon the production code) but then ASDF &amp; QuickLisp both strongly
pushed me to have that definition it its own <code>.asd</code> file<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> which seemed
awkward to me. I personally have no problem shipping tests with the production
code, and I believe that if needed all the symbols of the test package could
be <code>unintern</code>-ed before an image was saved if desired.</p>

<p>I’ll play around with this setup and see how things go.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Just a quick post about chapters 14 &amp; 15 of GOOS to get myself back into the
swing of things after a while…)</p>

<p>A few points hit me during these two chapters. Things which I <em>know</em> but which
perhaps are not entirely second nature to me yet (even after all these years)</p>

<ul>
  <li>In chapter 14 new features were added with little fuss - the relatively
clean design allowed for this.</li>
  <li>Chapter 15 showed doing refactorings bit by bit - it kept tests red for a
while but they got done. Just because it will take a while doesn’t mean not
    to do it.</li>
  <li>Chapter 15 also saw the developers thinking about how to continue down the
path they were one was going to be pretty annoying/boring. They took this
to mean that they were doing something wrong. They stopped and thought
about it and found a better design which allowed their needed changes to be
easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are three important things to internalize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good clean design leads to ease in implementing new features.</li>
  <li>A refactoring might be hard - but that is not a reason not to do it.</li>
  <li>If the change you need to do is hard / annoying - step back and figure out
why (see the first point).</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all things I <em>know</em>; but in the heat of the moment will tend to
forget. I need to really get them internalized; then I can <em>choose</em> to ignore
them at certain circumstances, but then I’ll do it more explicitly and know
the pros and cons.</p>

<p>Also as a side note there were some good points where the OO design skills
shone through. For example the addition of Java <code>enum</code> objects which quickly
became feature-ful objects which caused cleaner code elsewhere (<code>Column</code> and
<code>SniperState</code>)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(This post is long overdue… sorry about that).</p>

<p>This chapter was not to long but had some points that were interesting to me.</p>

<p>Firstly the thought that refactoring before and after a change should be about
<em>clarifying</em> the code via its design. This should not be thought of as
<em>cleaning</em> or <em>gold plating</em>.</p>

<p>I found it interesting right when the Authors said that the job was not done
because the code was ‘feeling messy’ my gut was telling me that the code was
not too bad. This is something I’ve noticed. I think my gut is wrong and needs
some new calibration.</p>

<p>The last item I wanted to point out was the idea that you should defer
refactoring decisions until you can see/feel what the problems are. But to do
this you must know that you will take the time to refactor when you know that
refactoring is right. If you don’t have confidence - you will refactor
prematurely.</p>

    <link href="http://code-and-cocktails.heroku.com/blog/2012/07/02/goos-review-chapter-12/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-02T21:25:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://code-and-cocktails.heroku.com/blog/2012/07/02/goos-review-chapter-12</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this chapter we implement our first <em>real</em> acceptance test. It is an
end-to-end test of a real user feature.</p>

<p>I tend to run my tests repeatedly as I write them - so I hit a problem before
the Authors revealed it. It was the <em>surprise</em> problem of the connection
needing to be closed. I guess my running of tests often led me to find it
earlier than others might - so I’ll take that as a win. It was annoying to
hit it before the Author’s intended though - I thought I had a broken OpenFire
installation.</p>

<p>There were four things that stood out for me in this chapter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Their note about using the same value in test code and production code
(<em>e.g.</em> JOIN_MESSAGE_FORMAT) on p109.  This is a problem that I struggle
with in my testing. Sometimes I feel that it is cheating - or not really
testing anything. Other times I think it is the “Right Thing To Do(TM)”. I
am glad/disappointed that they have conclusive word on if it is good/bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They start implementation of the new feature by first refactoring the
existing code into one that will make the needed change easy. This is
something I’d like to internalize but I haven’t yet. I usually start by
implementing what I need (even if hard/ugly) and then refactoring until it
is nice and clean. But this often leads to 
<a href="http://bible.cc/matthew/13-42.htm">wailing and gnashing of teeth</a>. I also think, in retrospect that
I have missed the target of the really nice design, which no longer can
really see, but I <em>feel</em> is still out there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a phrase on p113 which I think is a good feel for how I usually
am thinking when I am implementing: “…our immediate concern is to get
message translation to work, the rest can wait.” It is this focusing on the
immediate problem and ‘faking-till-you-make-it’ that I do a lot. I like to
commit often - so I am always working hard to get small bits working and
committed instead of trying to do bigger chunks of work (although I can’t
say I am always successful in this).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On p116 the Authors say that the expectation is the most important line of
the test. However I find that it is hidden in the Java code needed to
create it. Perhaps it is because I always look at a test in the ‘arrange,
act, assert’ way; so I don’t expect to see an expectation in the ‘arrange’
section but in the ‘assert’ section (as it would be with Spock, Mockito, or
Moq for example). I wonder how else it could be made more visible?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally they point out the importance of writing the ‘first draft’ code and
then refactoring it after the tests are working. I don’t think I could
agree with this more strongly.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>On the whole a good chapter for the first real user-feature. I am still
annoyed with plain old Java code. Maybe I’ll need to start re-implementing
this in Ruby or at least Groovy sooner rather than later.</p>
