    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a note (perhaps for my future self).</p>

<p>I had considerable problems after upgrading Octopress and then trying
to deploy my blog to Heroku.</p>

<p>The problems stemmed from the update to the Gemfile. There were two problems:</p>

<p>Firstly: everything except for <code>sinatra</code> was put into the
<code>:development</code> group. Heroku runs <code>bundle --without=development</code> so
all those gems will be missing.</p>

<p>Secondly: due to an earlier problem with the <code>pygment</code> and python
environments I need to keep the following in my Gemfile</p>

<pre><code>gem 'pygments.rb', '= 0.2.3'
gem 'rubypython', '= 0.5.1'
</code></pre>

<p>After I fixed those two problems deploying to Heroku worked fine.</p>

<p>One bright side is that I now know how to use <code>heroku
releases:rollback</code> to shift back to a previous version. This let me
keep my blog up and running while I tried to figure out the problem.
(Not that anyone actually reads it…)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After I posted my last blog post it was reported to me that my code blocks
were no displaying properly. The readers were seeing an error like: <code>"Liquid
error: Could not open library ‘/usr/local/lib/libpython2.7.a’: ...".</code></p>

<p>Some googling informed me that the problem seemed to be somewhere in
RubyPython. The instructions were relatively straightforward - but it wasn’t
clear to me if I needed to do <em>both</em> of the directions.</p>

<p>The quick answer is yes. To fix this problem one must do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure RubyPython is locked to 0.5.1 in the Gemfile (<em>i.e.</em> <code>gem
'rubypython', '= 0.5.1'</code></li>
  <li>Create a file <code>plugins/ruby_python_heroku_fix.rb</code> with the contents:
<code>RubyPython.configure :python_exe =&gt; 'python2.6'</code> (the filename is not
actually important).</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/2143368">this</a> updated migrator for <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/Jekyll">Jekyll</a> I have managed to
get all my old Posterous blog posts loaded into this Octopress blog.</p>

<p>There is still a problem with some posts - the media they contained are not
currently available.  I think it was the posts where I had emailed a picture
to Posterous (which would then bounced to Flickr and Twitter).  But any post I
composed as an email seems to be here.</p>

<p>The time it takes to generate the site has really dropped off unfortunately.
Hopefully it will not just get linearly worse…</p>
