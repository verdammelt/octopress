    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(It was noted to me that for a blog called ‘code and cocktails’ that I
don’t have many cocktail related posts - so here we go:)</p>

<p>I decided to try a new-to-me cocktail tonight and asked
<a href="http://cocktaildb.com/">cocktaildb</a> for cocktails which contain grapefruit and gin.  It suggested,
amongst others, the <a href="http://cocktaildb.com/recipe_detail?id=4758">Palm Beach Special</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 1/2 oz. gin</li>
  <li>3/4 oz. grapefruit juice</li>
  <li>1/2 oz. sweet vermouth</li>
  <li>shake well with ice, strain into cocktail glass.</li>
</ul>

<p>I enjoy the combination of gin and grapefruit in this drink but I have two
issues with it which I’d like to experiment with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I think it is too heavy on the gin - I think it overloads the grapefruit.</li>
  <li>I wonder if something like St. Germaine might be a good exchange for sweet
vermouth - obviously it would change the drink - but I think it might be
for the better.</li>
</ol>

<p>As an aside: cocktaildb is a great resource - I wish I could filter out drinks
for which I don’t have ingredients however.  That is why I am building
(slowly) my own cocktail recipe website <a href="http://defdrink.heroku.com"><code>(defdrink)</code></a>. (The primary
purpose of <code>(defdrink)</code> is to be a vehicle for me to learn <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>)</p>
