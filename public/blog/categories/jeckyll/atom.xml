    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/2143368">this</a> updated migrator for <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/Jekyll">Jekyll</a> I have managed to
get all my old Posterous blog posts loaded into this Octopress blog.</p>

<p>There is still a problem with some posts - the media they contained are not
currently available.  I think it was the posts where I had emailed a picture
to Posterous (which would then bounced to Flickr and Twitter).  But any post I
composed as an email seems to be here.</p>

<p>The time it takes to generate the site has really dropped off unfortunately.
Hopefully it will not just get linearly worseâ€¦</p>
