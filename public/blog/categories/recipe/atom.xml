    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the interest in breaking my current blogging writing block I’ll record for
posterity my ‘recipe’ for chicken soup.</p>

<p>First you need to eat some chicken so you have bones. I usually get rotisserie
chickens for another recipe (Skillet Chicken Pot Pie) and then save the
bones in the freezer. I use two carcasses for this recipe.</p>

<p>So take the bones and entomb them in a big pot with some carrots, celery,
garlic and onion. Don’t worry about chopping up the vegetables or even peeling
them - this step is making stock.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/8732668241/" title="Look at the bones!"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7286/8732668241_6e4ae3c78d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Look at the bones!" /></a></p>

<p>(The clever ones among you will note that I didn’t tell you how much of these
things to put in. I am doing this in honor of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/4309417102/">mother</a> on this
Mother’s Day.)</p>

<p>Now put in enough water to drown it all…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/8732668733/" title="Now with water"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/8732668733_30888ab230.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Now with water" /></a></p>

<p>and bring it to a boil.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/8732669071/" title="Starting to Simmer"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7296/8732669071_920961006f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Starting to Simmer" /></a></p>

<p>Let it boil for as long as you can stand to. You want it to get all the good
tastes out of the chicken bones and vegetables. I usually let it go for 2-4
hours and stir it occasionally. I don’t let it boil down more than half-way
however.</p>

<p>At this point it should be filling up your house with a very
delicious aroma.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/8732669473/" title="Boiling down"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7285/8732669473_99a9d98ebe.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Boiling down" /></a></p>

<p>After boiling it down you need to strain out all the solid bits and throw them
away. I have not included a picture of this because it looks rather unpleasant
and might put you off the recipe. But take my word for it - this bit of
unpleasantness will be worth it.</p>

<p>What you have now is chicken stock. Do with it what you will!</p>

<p>I usually choose to turn right around and create soup. I now put in carrots,
celery, onion, garlic, maybe peas. These, since you will be eating them should
be peeled, cleaned, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/8732669819/" title="Now making it into soup"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7308/8732669819_46a1cabb11.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Now making it into soup" /></a></p>

<p>I usually, because I am lazy, add a pasta to this soup, but potato or rice
could be used instead.</p>

<p>Bon Appetit!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/4309417102/">Mother’s</a> Kartoffelsalat (Potato Salad) recipe is a German style
potato salad; not one with mayonnaise. This is the type I grew up with and I
think the other type is just <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>One day many years ago I asked my mother from the recipe and she gave it to
me. Trouble was - she didn’t have any measurements. It was all done by how
much seemed good. I present the recipe to you in the same way.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Potatoes. Boiled until they are cooked through - but not mushy. Cut up
potatoes if some are much bigger than others (so they cook evenly). Then
sliced into approx 1/4” slices. Peeling is optional.</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Vinegar</li>
  <li>Salt &amp; Pepper</li>
  <li>Onion - chopped</li>
  <li>Garlic - minced</li>
  <li>(optional) Bacon - cut into little pieces and cooked crisp.</li>
  <li>(optional) Cucumber - sliced very thin.</li>
</ul>

<p>I usually make it with 5lbs of potatoes (because I am bringing it to
Thanksgiving dinner for example). For that much potato 1-2 onions will be good
and something like a tablespoon of garlic (hard to have too much for me).</p>

<p>After slicing the potatoes while still hot and adding garlic and onion put in
oil and vinegar - make sure the potatoes are well coated. I like it to be a
bit sour so I make sure there is a bit more vinegar than oil.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>Can be served warm after cooking or cold, or reheated in a microwave, or fried
up in a pan (Papa did that one time when Mama was in the hospital and I was
still pretty young).</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following is the recipe for “Washabinaros Chili”, we found it on
<a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/washabinaros-chili">All Recipes</a>. It
serves 8.</p>

<p>The startling parts of the recipe which always attract people’s
attention when I describe it is the wasabi paste, the beer and the
coffee.</p>

<p>The recipe is not difficult but takes time. The prepping can take
20-30 minutes, and the total cooking time is 3 hours. However it is
worth the time.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>4 tbl vegetable oil, divide</li>
  <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
  <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

  <li>14.5 oz peeled/diced tomatoes with juice</li>
  <li>12 oz dark beer</li>
  <li>1 cup strong brewed coffee</li>
  <li>12 oz tomato paste</li>
  <li>14 oz beef broth</li>
  <li>1/4 cup chili powder</li>
  <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 tbl ground cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
  <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tblspn wasabi paste</li>
  <li>45 oz kidney beans</li>
  <li>2 Anaheim chili peppers, chopped</li>
  <li>1 Serrano chili pepper, chopped</li>
  <li>1 Habenero pepper, sliced</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Place 2 tblsp oil in large pot over medium heat</li>
  <li>Cook &amp; stir onions, garlic, beef &amp; sausage until meats are tender</li>
  <li>Pour in tomatoes, coffee, beer, tomato paste &amp; broth</li>
  <li>Season with chili powder, cumin, sugar, oregano, cayenne,
coriander, salt &amp; wasabi.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1/3 of the beans, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover &amp;
simmer.</li>
  <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the remaining oil.</li>
  <li>Cook the chilies in the oil until just tender, 5-10 min.</li>
  <li>Add peppers to pot and simmer 2 hours.</li>
  <li>Add remaining beans &amp; cook for additional 45 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>We use mostly Chipolte chili powder in this recipe, it really adds a
great taste and kick.</p>

<p>Also pick a good dark beer, a really ‘chewy’ stout. The last time I
made it I used
<a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18371/54019">Babayaga Stout by Pretty Things</a>. Of course enjoy the rest of the bottle while cooking.</p>
