  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">GOOS</a> severals years ago but I have decided to reread it as I felt I
didn’t think it really got into my head the first time. Definitely I did
become more comfortable with mocking in tests - but I felt there was probably
more that I missed. So I am rereading it - and more importantly - taking a few
notes. It is those notes that I will be writing about, every chapter or two -
hopefully not a project that will end in a whimper.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>

<h3 id="a-learning-process">A learning process</h3>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="Software is a learning process.">
“Software is a learning process.” I am not sure why I didn’t catch this
last time. It is something that makes absolute sense to me now; and moreover I
don’t know a time when it would <em>not</em> have made sense to me over the last
decade. If software is a learning process, getting feedback on that learning
is of utmost importance.
</span></p>

<h3 id="nothing-to-lose">Nothing to lose</h3>

<p>The boxed-text about ‘nothing to lose but your bugs’ strikes me as ‘sales
pitch’. Having believed, then being bitten by this catch phrase I don’t buy
it. TDD will not help the developers write the right feature - just help
ensure that what they write is what they intended. It is not a silver bullet;
and I’d think that Pryce and Freeman had not intended that; so I hope that
I’ll see something that backs up this claim from them.</p>

<p>(However I <em>do</em> feel that implementing via TDD helps drive out cases that
might get missed until later exploratory testing. By finding them earlier in
the process we have a big win.)</p>

<p>After finishing the rest of the chapter I see their claim is that all the
levels of TDD practices: end-to-end; integration and unit; could reduce the
chance of writing the wrong code.</p>

<h3 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h3>

<p>Pryce and Freeman say that refactoring is a local change. This made me
immediately realize that easily fall into <em>large</em> refactorings. This is
something I want to keep an eye on. Not just for refactorings - but for any
work - I should work in small chunks.</p>

<h3 id="a-rose-by-any-other-name">A rose by any other name…</h3>

<p>It annoys me that there are so many terms for different levels of tests. I
personally use ‘Integration’ test for any test that integrates two or more
components (except for those sets of components which I consider a Unit - then
of course that would be a Unit test…). They keep talking about ‘Acceptance
Tests’ which to me are ‘User Tests’ - and given I just got back from some
training from Jim Shore I am currently at least moderately against automated
user tests. I do like End-to-End tests - that they call Acceptance test - but
need to keep them under control since they have the drawback of slowness and
brittleness.</p>

<p>I really like to have clear terms for things - terms that are understood
generally by people. I think it eases communication. That being said I see in
myself a lacking of clarity when I discuss topics. Reading this book is
bringing this up to me; perhaps it is something I need to work on for myself.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>

<h3 id="a-web-of-messages">A web of messages</h3>

<p>I think the important idea presented in this chapter is the idea the domain
concepts are not embodied by a particular classes in your code but by the
connections of those classes embodied by the messages that they pass each
other. This is an idea I remember having trouble with when I first read this
book and I am again having a little trouble making it concrete in my head.
Hopefully this second read will help solidify it.</p>

<h3 id="values--objects">Values &amp; Objects</h3>

<p>The authors present a nice terminology for two types of collections of data
and functionality found in code. Simply: <em>Values</em> are immutable without
distinct identity; <em>Objects</em> have changing state and have distinct identity.</p>

<p>Here again is a reminder to me to have a clear, consistent terminology to aid
in communication.</p>

<h3 id="tell-dont-ask">Tell don’t ask</h3>

<p>While I am familiar with the “Law of Demeter”, it is one of those things that
seems to quickly fall by the wayside as I code. Another thing to add to my
list of things to improve.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of good discussion about this on the internet - one
discussion and explanation of it I like is that from Avdi Grimm in his
blog post <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/07/05/demeter-its-not-just-a-good-idea-its-the-law/">Demeter: It’s not a good idea. It’s the law</a>. In it
he points to method chaining and points out:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;Look again at the definition of the Law: it never says anything about the
&gt;number of methods called, or the number of objects a method uses. It is
&gt;strictly concerned with the number of /types/ a method deals with.
</code></pre>

<p>So it is OK to chain a set of method calls together that all do different
things to collections of objects, or Strings for example; but not when there
are multiple different <em>types</em> of objects.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion-for-now">In Conclusion (for now)</h2>

<p>I am looking forward to continuing my rereading of this book. I think I will
gain from this review of important topics (Object Oriented Design and TDD). I
may not end up agreeing with it - but I hope to solidify my thoughts and
practices in this area through it.</p>

<p>Along the way I plan on continuing to take notes and then making blog posts
about it. I think through this process I will do an even better job of
understanding what I have read. I hope you all don’t mind too much.</p>

<h2 id="postscript---chapter-3">Postscript - Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Chapter 3 was a discussion about using JMock. Nothing really to note or
report.  I have no yet decided what language(s) I will be using while doing
the exercises.  I think I may just do it in Java with JMock so that I can
easily follow along with their examples. However another part of me wants to
do them in Ruby or Groovy or Clojure to help me compare and contrast.</p>

<p>In any case, any code written will of course be published to <a href="https://github.com/verdammelt">my
Github</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>I am returning home from the <a href="http://www.cyrusinnovation.com/index.php/art-of-agile-nyc">Art of Agile Boot Camp</a> presented by
<a href="http://www.jamesshore.com">James Shore</a> and <a href="http://www.futureworksconsulting.com">Diana Larsen</a> in New York City.</p>

<p>The training turned out to be review for me given that most of my coworkers
are <a href="http://www.cyrusinnovation.com">Cyrus Innovations</a> employees and they all attended this training
in October of 2011. They came back and implemented some of the ideas from the
training - so in a way I’ve been living this stuff since then. Even before
that we were a pretty well functioning agile team.</p>

<p>Even though it was a review I still thought it was very beneficial to me.
There are always opportunities to improve; and details/reasonings that had
been forgotten. Old ideas can become new again through re-iteration.</p>

<p>The training was split into two parts. The first two days covered Agile
Planning and the last three Agile Delivery. The latter was what I was most
interested in - but I think I may have gotten just as much out of the first
section.</p>

<h3 id="90-minute-iterations---crazy">90 Minute Iterations?! - Crazy!</h3>

<p>It was in the second half of the class that we got to “experience” Agile
Delivery for ourselves. In our groups we delivered working software four times
in four iterations; each iteration was 90 minutes long. It seemed crazy and a
few times it felt crazy - but we did deliver running software (a cheesy text
based ‘game’) in 90 minute iterations. During these 90 minutes we did
everything from release planning, to coding (TDD’d naturally), exploratory
testing, and releasing.</p>

<p>Crazy as it may seem - it is a brilliant exercise. By making us so focused we
needed to organize ourselves, help each other out and really work to remove
all roadblocks. Also it forced us to make, quickly, decisions about what was
going to be in and what was not. We couldn’t let ego get in the way and argue
too much about anything; we could always pivot and change our minds later.</p>

<h3 id="relearning-what-stories-are">Relearning what Stories are</h3>

<p>Even as a well functioning agile team I have to say that there were some
things related to stories that I now think I/We were doing wrong or not so
well.  Firstly, I was reminded that Stories are not requirements. Stories are
conversations about the requirements and they are negotiable. It is really
important that they are small and independent. A story on its own is not
likely to be a complete feature (MMF) - they ought to be much smaller than
that.</p>

<p>Another point about stories that Jim makes a point of is that they should not
be re-estimated. This seemed odd to me so I made a point to discuss it
further. It seemed to me that one should re-estimate a story if more
information is known. For example we may come to know that the implementation
needed for a story is harder than first thought, or easier (perhaps it is
becoming routine).</p>

<p>Jim’s point is that estimates are always wrong, but they should be consistent.
So if something was estimated as a ‘1’; then anything like it should also be a
‘1’; even if find out that it was easier/harder. The reason is because if we
change our estimations then our velocity becomes less meaningful. It is our
velocity that should be changing to reflect our capability for doing N 1-point
stories. That N will go up and down as 1 point stories are harder/easier.</p>

<h3 id="velocity-settling">Velocity: settling</h3>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="Decrease velocity easily. Increase velocity pessimistically"></span></p>

<p>Instead of simply doing <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YesterdaysWeather">Yesterday’s Weather</a>, Jim
suggests letting velocity ‘settle’. The way he put it was: 
Decrease velocity easily. Increase velocity pessimistically.<br />
The idea is that if you always use Yesterday’s Weather that your velocity may
tend to to be erratic, and more importantly that it prevents the team from
having consistent time for <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack</a>. While I can understand this
intellectually I find it hard to grok. Perhaps that is because of long
standing bad habits from previous work environments. It is something I’d like
to experiment with.</p>

<p>&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-delivering-value">Focus on Delivering Value</h3>

<p>Duh. I just needed to be reminded of this.</p>

<h3 id="fluencies">Fluencies</h3>

<p>Diana and Jim presented an idea of ‘Fluency’ in Agile Practices. Each level is
useful, none of them are ‘bad’.  They are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We build code.</li>
  <li>We create business value.</li>
  <li>We <em>deliver</em> business value.</li>
  <li>We <em>optimize</em> business value.</li>
  <li>We optimize <em>our organization’s</em> business value.</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea is that you are ‘fluent’ at a level, as with a language, when you can
easily work at that level, even under pressure. I think our current team, and
myself, is largely fluent at the level of delivering business value and
day-to-day we do some work at the level of optimizing that value.</p>

<h2 id="so-what">So What</h2>

<h3 id="the-first-thing-to-build">The First Thing to Build…</h3>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="The First thing to build is Trust"></span></p>

<p>Diana mentioned a good quote: The First thing to build is Trust. The
idea is that the first thing the team needs to get good at is delivering on
its commitments - consistently.</p>

<p>&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<h3 id="iteration-planning-is-a-design-activity">Iteration Planning is a design activity</h3>

<p>This is an interesting idea that I need to think more about. The idea is that
because Iteration Planning involves choices about what will be built; that it
affect design.</p>

<h3 id="people-over">People over…</h3>

<p>I always find interacting with people who are interested in or driven to
learning very energizing. A change in this time I realized what that now I was
the person who was answering questions of and encouraging people who were new
to Agile. I am starting to realize that I know this stuff and have something
to offer. It was also great to see a coworker doing the same, and doing a
better job than I did.</p>

<h2 id="now-what">Now What</h2>

<p>There are some things I want to try for myself and for my team.</p>

<h3 id="demos">Demos</h3>

<p>Right now on my current project we do not have Customer Demos. I said a few
times during the training that my project does not yet have a Customer, but
what it really doesn’t have is a User. I think we could start demoing it now
to whoever wanted to see it. At the least demoing to fellow team members may
help us be focused and see a bigger picture.</p>

<h3 id="story-sizing">Story sizing</h3>

<p>Currently our features are not quite <em>Minimum</em> Marketable Features. They tend
to be larger than that. Furthermore it seems our Product Manager (the Customer
Proxy) doesn’t care much about anything smaller than that. However that is
leaving us with only a story or two per iteration - which is not helping us
achieve a more stable velocity.</p>

<p>I need to do some brainstorming on how we can (or if we should) shrink our
features. Then figure out ways to split stories into smaller chunks so we can
have several per iteration (at least 4). The important thing here is to keep
business value in each story. While I do not think this will magically cause
my Product Manager to care about the smaller stories; but I hope it will help
engage them more if we can show business value progress with each one.</p>

<p>Related to this is the problem that it seems there may be some expectations
about when the current release will be shippable. My current projections are
much further out from those expectations. I need to use tools like Velocity,
Release Planning with Risk calculations (ala <a href="http://www.teamrabu.com/">Rabu</a> which I currently
use) to bring data to the table in my discussions with the Product and Project
Managers.</p>

<h3 id="root-cause-analysis">Root Cause Analysis</h3>

<p>Now that I’ve had this review I feel that I and my team have not been doing a
good job of doing root cause analysis on the issues in our process which we
discuss in our Retrospectives. Furthermore we are not doing a good job of root
cause analysis on any bugs that come up.</p>

<p>(On the topic of bugs I want to more seriously have the “Bugs don’t happen
here” attitude.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion the training was fantastic - even for someone who is not new to
Agile methodologies. I am bringing back some good ideas which may help me and
my team achieve even better fluency in our work. It also solidified for me
some existing ideas that I thought I/we already did pretty well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I posted my last blog post it was reported to me that my code blocks
were no displaying properly. The readers were seeing an error like: <code>"Liquid
error: Could not open library ‘/usr/local/lib/libpython2.7.a’: ...".</code></p>

<p>Some googling informed me that the problem seemed to be somewhere in
RubyPython. The instructions were relatively straightforward - but it wasn’t
clear to me if I needed to do <em>both</em> of the directions.</p>

<p>The quick answer is yes. To fix this problem one must do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure RubyPython is locked to 0.5.1 in the Gemfile (<em>i.e.</em> <code>gem
'rubypython', '= 0.5.1'</code></li>
  <li>Create a file <code>plugins/ruby_python_heroku_fix.rb</code> with the contents:
<code>RubyPython.configure :python_exe =&gt; 'python2.6'</code> (the filename is not
actually important).</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="a-tragedy-of-my-own-devising">(<em>A Tragedy of My Own Devising</em>)</h2>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>I had a lot of problems setting up my first <a href="https://github.com/marick/Midje">Midje</a> tests for my <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>
project <a href="http://defdrink.heroku.com">(defdrink)</a> last night and thought it might be useful for me to
write about it.</p>

<p>(And helpful it was… I see plenty of mistakes I made and summarize the
lessons learned at the end).</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>First a quick background. <a href="http://defdrink.heroku.com">(defdrink)</a> will be/is a web application which
will assist in the choosing of a cocktail based upon the contents of the users
liquor cabinet. I am using this project as a means of learning <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. I
have put all the source on <a href="https://github.com/verdammelt/defdrink">github</a> (as one does…) and in
this post will refer to particular commits to illustrate different steps.</p>

<h2 id="in-the-beginning">In the Beginning…</h2>

<p>At the point where our story begins I had slapped together a quick (and ugly)
prototype. The purpose of the prototype was to get a Clojure project which has
a web page which allowed retrieving and saving data into a database; all
served up on Heroku. Being a prototype - it had not tests (horrors). This
moment in time is <a href="https://github.com/verdammelt/defdrink/tree/0da77fbafc87634e94e0342e409e5b071b8d6c1f">commit 0da77fbafc87634e94e0342e409e5b071b8d6c1f</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trying-to-put-in-the-first-midje-test">Trying to put in the first Midje test.</h2>

<p>It took me two tries to get my first Midje test (and that first test merely
proved that Arithmetic worked: <code>(fact (+ 2 2) =&gt; 4)</code>).</p>

<p>My first attempt was me doing what I thought was ‘obvious’ and what I thought
the Midje wiki was telling me I should be able to do: put a bit of magic in my
<code>projects.clj</code> file and then a test file with a <code>(fact ...)</code> in it.</p>

<p>That attempt ending with frustration at the fact the only feedback I was
getting was a bunch of Java stack traces.</p>

<p>My second attempt was simply making these same stumblings - I had wrongly
assumed that I had I simply not <em>quite</em> understood the previous time.</p>

<p>After I realized that my second attempt was heading toward another failure I
finally rolled back and tried to take the next smallest step.  I wanted to run
Midje (with <a href="https://github.com/stuartsierra/lazytest">Lazytest</a>) and get it to report something like “0 tests”. With
the help of the <a href="https://github.com/marick/lein-midje">lein-midje plugin Readme</a> I got this
<a href="https://github.com/verdammelt/defdrink/commit/cd4fad91dbcb7803f49f234474bbb3d3ad3d1295">working</a> in not too much time. If you look at that commit
you will notice a glaring error - one that was not obvious to me as I tried to

<h2 id="my-first-midje-test">My first Midje test…</h2>

<h3 id="a-problem-of-my-own-devising">A Problem of My Own Devising</h3>

<p>Ages ago when I started this project I ran <code>lein new defdrink</code> and then, since
I didn’t have any tests, I removed the <code>test</code> subdirectory. Now, a month
later, I couldn’t remember just how the test directory was supposed to be laid
out, and it was obvious to me that it needed to have some special directory
tree/naming to find the files etc. Mixed into that was a lack of understanding
Clojure namespaces and directory structures (this was just me being dense).
At this point I kept getting stack traces about not finding namespaces, which
all seemed right - but obviously lein, midje, clojure or all three didn’t
agree.</p>

<p>Finally I had just ran <code>lein new foo</code> in a temp directory and saw the
structure needed.  That was the clue I needed – the clue  I couldn’t find
this little simple piece of information out on the web either for Midje or
Clojure’s own test framework. Now that I had the directory structure right,
the namespace in the file right it would work right? <em>Right?</em></p>

<h3 id="wrong">…wrong…</h3>

<p>As I am sure all of you playing along at home can see - I never added a
dependency on Midje itself in the previous step. That means at this point I
started getting messages that said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could not locate midje/sweet__init.class or midje/sweet.clj on classpath</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me tell you this was very confusing after all I knew that I already
had Midje working. Now that I added a test it says it can’t find Midje?!
Finally I saw my error and fixed it.  Now at long last, I had a Midje test!
Of course it was just a <a href="https://github.com/verdammelt/defdrink/commit/0c3840cea7d4f5e1d0258a8cd6b087f949e0c6c2">dummy test</a> but it was actually running.</p>

<h2 id="now-lets-do-it-for-reals">Now, let’s do it for reals…</h2>

<p>My next step was to get a real test. My premise for these tests was to remove
some hardcoded SQL code in my model class. I was going to push that code down
into a couple helper classes so that I could isolate myself from the database.
The first test was to show that my <code>defdrink/all</code> method would delegate down
to my new <code>sql/select</code> method with the <code>:drinks</code> parameter (that is the
table name).</p>

<p>I once again had some odd and annoying problems with the only feedback being
cryptic stack traces.  I don’t remember all the details but they involved
statements such as ‘provided not being defined in this context’ - which led me
down wild chases to determine if I had all the right modules required etc.
Fortunately/unfortunately the problems resolved themselves (I hate that) and I
got my first <a href="https://github.com/verdammelt/defdrink/commit/dfc494f7b4ea50b67138605308be1967d9d8dcd4">real test running</a>:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>A Small Step for One Programmer</span><a href="https://github.com/verdammelt/defdrink/blob/dfc494f7b4ea50b67138605308be1967d9d8dcd4/test/defdrink/test/models/drinks.clj">defdrink/test/defdrink/test/models/drinks.clj </a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">      (provided (sql/select :drinks) =&gt; [...drink1... ...drink2...]))</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>(I sort of like how it turned out… I like the <a href="https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Metaconstants">metacontstants</a> feature and
am excited to try it out more.)</p>

<h2 id="and-now-for-my-encore">And now for my encore…</h2>

<p>Now that the select statement was sequestered, I turned my attention to the
insert statement.  This is where I again ran into problems.</p>

<p>This new test, like the previous, was going to be a simple test of delegation.
Did the model layer properly call down to the database layer to query or
persist the data.  The test I wanted to write was to say that the
<code>defdrink/save</code> method called the <code>sql/insert</code> method with the correct
parameters.  My first attempt at this ended… (wait for it…) in
frustration.</p>

<h3 id="whats-wrong-this-time">What’s wrong <em>THIS</em> time?!</h3>

<p>In Ruby or Java/Groovy I’d simply have my test call my method and test the
expectation on my mock object that the <code>sql/insert</code> method was called with the
correct parameters. Unfortunatly for me, I could not figure out how to do that
in Midje. I ended with the following unhappy test:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>An Unhappy Test</span><a href="https://github.com/verdammelt/defdrink/blob/9fbb73b327e7509e2612932dfedc97e8e55330ce/test/defdrink/test/models/drinks.clj">defdrink/test/defdrink/test/models/drinks.clj </a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">(fact
</span><span class="line">     (insert ...name...) =&gt; ...not-important...
</span><span class="line">     (provided (sql/insert :drinks {:name ...name...}) =&gt; ...not-important...))</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I’ll freely admit that while trying to write this test I began to have doubts
(which I still hold) that perhaps I shouldn’t even by <em>trying</em> to right this
test. It just seemed like a code smell to me. The way the test ended up seems
to be telling me: “Mark, just what are you thinking?!”</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion (finally) my problems were much of my own devising. Whether it
was shooting myself in the foot, trying to do something quickly because “its
easy right?”, not yet understanding this language/environment I am trying to
work in, or simply because I am trying to write Clojure tests as I would Ruby
or Java tests – I’ve had a hard time getting to <a href="https://github.com/verdammelt/defdrink/tree/9fbb73b327e7509e2612932dfedc97e8e55330ce">this point</a>.</p>

<p>Even admitting my own problems, I have to say, IMNSHO that it would have been
nice to see a tutorial/cookbook out there of how to get started with Midje.
What I’d have liked to have found would be something which stepped me through:</p>

<ol>
  <li>what to put in my <code>project.clj</code> file for midje, lazytest, and lien</li>
  <li>a simple example of getting one’s first tests off the ground</li>
  <li>and then a bit more showing mocking for example.</li>
</ol>

<p>In researching this blog post I see I did overlook some resources on the Midje
wiki that would have helped, at least with the second two points.</p>

<p>So the moral is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>slow down</li>
  <li>small steps</li>
  <li><em>read</em> the docs, not just look at them.</li>
</ol>

<p>I do think I might try to contribute this sort of tutorial to the Midje
project. Because I can’t be the only dope who thinks he knows what he’s
doing, who will get frustrated because there is not a tutorial to hold his
hand through the first steps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/7076702975/" title="We arrived by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7262/7076702975_aa72f9797f_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="We arrived" /></a></div>

<p>We were going to see Kraftwerk at MoMA and the trip didn’t start well as we
sat in stop-and-go traffic through Connecticut right into NYC. Luckily we were
not driving ourselves, but I still worried this was an ill omen. We even had
trouble finding some quick food before the show.  Even with all these problems
the show was fantastic.</p>

<p>Wendy and I staked our claim to a bench off to the side and at the back while
the surprisingly young crowd filled in in front of the stage.  The view was
just fine from where we were.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930626360/" title="Before the Start by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5160/6930626360_52c08a0863_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Before the Start" /></a></div>

<p>The show began with the dropping of the curtain - showing the band at their
podiums.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930628196/" title="Man Machine by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7256/6930628196_f0e9f55d7d_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Man Machine" /></a></div>

<p>They started the album off by playing Man-Machine and with the 3d glasses the
visuals were interesting…  but when Spacelab started they were fantastic.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930629942/" title="Spacelab by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7245/6930629942_d14e740db0_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Spacelab" /></a></div>

<p>The images of Spacelab orbiting the earth was great. They even used a cheap 3d trick of having the
orbiting ship head straight into the audience; cheap but still fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/7076706387/" title="Spacelab by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7254/7076706387_c0350cb588_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Spacelab" /></a></p>

<p>The huge looming buildings, and slow pans through them fit with the song
Metropolis perfectly.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930631270/" title="Metropolis by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5322/6930631270_7e2b6fa0c7_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Metropolis" /></a></div>

<p>The visuals for The Model were all black-and-white fashion shots - not much
more interesting in ‘3d’ than not, but the next song (Neon Lights) used the 3d
effects better.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930632608/" title="Neon Lights by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7231/6930632608_bf42a511dc_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Neon Lights" /></a></div>

<p>The album performance was capped off with We are the Robots. Everyone went
wild over the robo-kraftwerk dancing and looming over the audience.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930633680/" title="We are the Robots by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/6930633680_f64f6eef0f_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="We are the Robots" /></a></div>

<p>Now that the album was over I was not sure what to expect; I was not
disappointed with their choice of Autobahn - the visuals being computer
generated VW Beetle and other cars on a seemingly infinite Autobahn. The song
ended with VW pulling off the highway.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930634846/" title="Autobahn by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7202/6930634846_dee3cd91e6_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Autobahn" /></a></div>

<p>Up next was Radioactivity followed by Trans Europe Express. Then ComputerWorld
and Tour De France.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930638504/" title="Tour de France by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7214/6930638504_30f5ed2ac2_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Tour de France" /></a></div>

<p>Then my phone battery died - so not more pictures. So you’ll have to take my
word on it that the rest of the show, including Technopop was fantastic.</p>

<p>My full set of pictures is availble on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/sets/72157629450241864/">flickr</a> stream</p>

<p>There is still a problem with some posts - the media they contained are not

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Well not quite true I don’t have a desk at all… but effectively I don’t
have one).</p>

<p>About a year ago I changed to a new job. In all previous jobs I’ve had I had a
desk, in fact I had a office (sometimes shared) or at least a cube of my own.
It was different at the new job; when I showed up on my first day at the new
work there was a little bit of confusion about what cube I could be given and
as a ‘temporary’ solution I was given a desk in the lab.</p>

<p>Given the way we work on the team, I spent very little time at my desk. It
became simply a place where I put my bag &amp; coat; a place for my coffee mug; a
place for my notebook at the end of the day. I did use it to check my email
first thing in the morning before everyone arrived (I’m an early person) - but
other than that - unused. As the months went on I used it less and less
everyday.</p>

<p>Then in January the new DBA consultant started sitting at it with his laptop
so he could be with the team; thus I was partially evicted from my ‘desk’. I
still kept my inbox there - but now I didn’t even use the desk to read my
email in the morning.</p>

<p>At this same time there was a new coworker starting and with that a little
angst about where they would sit (the cube situation was in fact no better;
but actually worse). A cube was found for her; but I felt that by giving up my
desk entirely I was making a personal statement about desks, cubes, offices.</p>

<p>I do have regrets periodically when I need to do some personal matters; but we
have a shared office nearby the lab and a few cubes that can be used in a
pinch for private work/calls.</p>

<p>In all - I have not really missed having a desk. I have found out that I don’t
need much more than space for my inbox; maybe someday space for some filing.
This conclusion is NOT what I would have expected from myself; I remember
clearly wanting an office and bemoaning my fate of being in cubes. It seems I
have accepted the team-room setting more than I had imagined I could have.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>(I finally went to <em>another</em> Boston Ruby meetup.  Only my second -
hopefully it will be less than ~9 months before I go to my third.)</p>

<p>Chad Fowler gave a talk entitled “Measuring &amp; Analyzing Things That
Matter When You Have Too Many Things To Keep Track Of” at tonights
Boston Ruby Meetup.  It was <em>the</em> reason why I went to the meetup.(But I
did enjoy the other two talks - but they are not the topic of this post)</p>

<p>His talk was, self-described, half-baked ideas.  Which is fine by me.
At @boston_sc we’ve started doing “half-baked” ideas talks and they have
been great - I only wish that this talk was more discussion style like
the ones we have at @boston_sc.</p>

<p>He talked about how even with a team of very good developers, good code
is not guaranteed.  The bad stuff builds up, even without people
noticing, via bad habits and laziness.  His person example of gaining a
lot of weight hits very solidly with me and I am again working to drop
my weight which keeps just sneaking back (due to bad habits and laziness
on my part).</p>

<h2 id="how-to-measure-how-readable-code-is">How to measure how readable code is</h2>

<p>He mentioned several thoughts about how to fight the bad
habits/laziness, but the one that got me thinking was about the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test">Flesch-Kincaid Readability
Scale</a>.</p>

<p>Basically in a nutshell Rudolph Flesch devised a algorithm for English
which let you compute a score which then equates to what level of
English reader could easily read and understand your English.  He
suggested that perhaps some combination of metrics (e.g. flog, flag,
roodi, churn, reek, (i.e. things from metric-fu)) might render a
<em>number</em> which would equate to a level of developer (his scale topped
out at Rich Hickey) that could understand your code.</p>

<p>The reason that this got me thinking especially was because it fits into
a less-than-half-baked idea I’ve had.  A few months ago I was working
with a junior developer at my job and while she was away I had
implemented a nice little bit of Groovy code to do something.  It
involved a chain of collection functions (<em>e.g.</em> map, inject, collect
etc.).  I thought it was great.  When she came back and saw it she
couldn’t understand it.  I explained it to her and she <em>started</em> to
understand.  I explained again and she <em>sort of</em> understood.  Then I
said “ok, hold on…” and replaced it with 2 for loops.  Totally dumb
un-cool code that did the same thing.  She immediately understood! So
that is what we committed.</p>

<p>The problem was that I was at a higher level of understanding of that
sort of pseudo-function collection function chaining.  (and also it
the code might have been a bit ‘clever’ <em>shudder</em>).  By shifting to
<em>ordinary</em> code it was easy to understand.</p>

<p>The thing I am interested in is if this scale of code comprehensibility
is if it is absolute or relative.  My first thought it is relative.  If
one can raise the base skill of a team then that team can understand
more esoteric code.</p>

<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other thoughts</h2>

<p>There were other interesting points in there - obviously rather ruby
specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mention of tools like flog, flay, roodi, reek, etc all good
at giving numbers about your code.</li>
  <li>Measuring whatever worries you</li>
  <li>Graphing everything you can</li>
  <li>(again) Getting information from your commit history</li>
</ul>

<p>These are also things that will keep me thinking for a bit.  I can use
these ideas both in my for-pay coding and my for-free/me coding.</p>

<p>Sometimes code doesn’t do anything.  Maybe a variable is no longer used, or a
whole function or class is no longer referenced by the rest of the code.  If
that happens, delete it.</p>

<p>This was shortly after a short conversation while partaking of aprés
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/boston-software-craftsmanship?pli=1">Boston Software Craftsmanship</a> beers in which I was asked about
cocktails and someone suggested getting cocktails after the meeting next time.
It was also immediately after I was asked when we were going to get cocktails
by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/zdsbs">@zdsbs</a> (prompted by my tweeting I had just purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Absinthe-Cocktails-Green-Fairy-ebook/dp/B006L63108">a book of
Absinthe Cocktail recipes</a>).</p>

<p>I did but jest (<em>poison in jest; no offense i’the world</em> [Hamlet
III.ii.234-235])…</p>

<p>But now I am thinking it through.</p>

<p>I have heard of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/events/48227772/">‘Code &amp; Coffee’</a>
and thought it a good idea.  A place to meet people who like code and coffee.
While I <strong>really</strong> like coffee, I also like cocktails and I seem to be
surrounded by people who get up later than I do - so why not meet <em>after</em> work
for cocktails and code?  <em>Brilliant!</em></p>

<p>So what would a Code’n’Cocktail look like?  I see a few possibilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A cocktail party where code/coding is the topic of conversation</li>
  <li>A coding dojo/coderetreat/code kata session with booze</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)"><em>salon</em></a> for
coding</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the first and last are very similar and given my inclinations I like
the connotations of referring to it as a <em>salon</em>.  I think that would be my
preference.  I would not want to limit it entirely to discussion; so some
coding would be good.</p>

<p>What do I hope attendees would get out of such an event?  I think attendees
should have fun and at least one of: learn something, teach something, make
contacts.</p>

<p>This sort of event would have to happen at a bar or someone’s home.  I don’t
see how it could happen at someone’s workplace or a place like <a href="http://microsoftcambridge.com/Default.aspx">NERD</a> as it
<strong>obviously</strong> needs a well stocked bar.  The problem is location.  The
Location would need to be able to accommodate an prior-to-event unknown number
of people (making a reservation would be difficult); and accommodate the
possibility of coding (standing at a bar may not work).  I think an off night
at a bar might work - the place would love to get business on a slow night…</p>

<p>The gears in my mind are turning.  If you have interest or thoughts please
comment or contact me.</p>
