  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="experts-dont-know-what-they-know">Experts Don’t Know what they Know</h2>

<p>This year’s SCNA Conference seemed to have several talks which touched upon
the idea of experts having implicit knowledge. That is to say: they know
things but can’t necessarily explain what they know, or why. Ken Auer and Dave
Thomas touched upon it; during the panel on Software Quality it was also
brought up (e.g.  Corey Haines’ amazing reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_sexing">Chicken Sexing</a>).
But I felt that Brian Marick’s talk took the idea and then added to it.</p>

<h2 id="bright-vs-dull-cows">Bright vs. Dull Cows</h2>

<p>Brian started talking about this implicit knowledge idea - giving his wife as
an example. His wife (a veterinary professor) teaches her students to
determine if a cow is ‘bright’ or ‘dull’ (a subjective diagnosis). Her
students specify, day-after-day, if cows are dull or bright. She then corrects
them. They usually ask how she could tell and she tells them something
(drooping ears, nose-cleaning, etc.). But actually these specific clues are
not <em>really the way to tell</em>. Those who can diagnose a cow as bright or dull
cannot explain why.</p>

<p>This anecdote seems to show that the implicit knowledge of the expert is
something that can be trained. When discussing this idea after the talk Corey
Haines mentioned a conference session in which Michael Feathers gave where he
had the attendees give quick good/bad judgment calls on snippets of code. Then
tallied those up and found that some snippets had a large amount of agreement
as to their good-/bad-ness. They then discussed and tried to determine why.
In light of Brian’s anecdote however it seems that they might never find out
<em>why</em>, but maybe they could train themselves by looking at a lot of code and
being corrected when they get the judgment wrong.</p>

<p>(Brian hopes to use this sort of idea to be able to train himself to have a
nearly physical reaction to bad code. While that sounds cool, I worry about a
‘Ludovico Technique’ for code.)</p>

<h2 id="effortful-vs-automatic">Effortful vs. Automatic</h2>

<p>Brian then talked about two types of thinking: Effortful and Automatic.
Effortful is the sort when you need to do a non-trivial arithmetic, or a
parking in a tight spot. Automatic is when you do simple math like 2+2 or easy
driving where you are sort of on autopilot. When you use the Effortful way, it
actually takes <em>effort</em>. It is slower seems to be only possible to do it
serially. Automatic thinking is faster, takes little effort, and seems to be
parallelizable.</p>

<p>If you don’t have something in Automatic then your brain shifts to Effortful;
sort of a cache miss.  If you do something enough, or become good enough at
it, you can put stuff into your Automatic cache.</p>

<h2 id="switching-to-automatic">Switching to Automatic</h2>

<p>So how can this be done? While Brian offers the usual ‘practice, practice,
practice’, he adds to it an interesting idea about ‘Set and Setting’. ‘Set and
Setting’ is an idea from Timothy Leary about why drugs such as LSD seem to
have very different effects in different people. The mindset (Set) of the
person (which includes things like rituals which build up that mindset) and
the Setting (environment) have a strong influence on the experiences of that
person.</p>

<p>By being aware of which mindsets (and how to enter them) and what settings are
most beneficial for programming (and even different types of programming) he
feels he can move some programming tasks into his Automatic thinking area.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It seems to me that the idea of ‘Automatic’ and ‘Effortful’ adds to the idea
of the expert’s implicit knowledge. Perhaps the expert’s knowledge is just an
expression of Automatic thinking?</p>

<p>I’m interested in trying out the practice of being more aware of my own ‘Set
and Setting’ with respect to code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am once again jumping into the Clojure world and trying to learn a bit of
it. I am doing so via a small project called <a href="http://defclink.heroku.com">defclink</a>
(<a href="http://github.com/verdammelt/defclink">source</a>). I am also attempting to get back into blogging. So I
thought I’d combine the two items into this short post.</p>

<h2 id="goals-of-my-project">Goals of my project.</h2>

<p>My goal of this project is to learn some Clojure building a webapp. I decided
to also use Clojurescript since it seemed like an interesting idea. I wanted
to keep the number of libraries and frameworks low to maximize the Clojure
code I would need to write, thus learning Clojure. That being said I allowed
myself the luxury of the Compojure library (with Ring under it) to handle the
HTML protocol stuffs.</p>

<p>I’ll start by explaining how to get a brand new Compojure project.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-up-a-compojure-project">How to set up a Compojure project</h2>

<p>Starting a Compojure project is very simple:</p>

<pre><code>lein new compojure awesome-thing
</code></pre>

<p>This will create:</p>

<pre><code>README.md    project.clj  resources/   src/         test/

./resources:
public/

./resources/public:

./src:
awesome_thing/

./src/awesome_thing:
handler.clj

./test:
awesome_thing/

./test/awesome_thing:
test/

./test/awesome_thing/test:
handler.clj
</code></pre>

<p>and furthermore will setup your project.clj file to pull in compojure.</p>

<p>It sets up simple tests that going to “/” will result in a <a href="http://httpcats.herokuapp.com/200">success page</a> with
“Hello World” and that going to a non-existant page will result in a <a href="http://httpcats.herokuapp.com/404">404</a>.
There is a defined set of routes to accomplish this.</p>

<p>To run the server at this point it is easy to do:</p>

<pre><code>lein ring server
</code></pre>

<p>and then go to <code>localhost:3000</code> to see the <code>awesome_thing</code></p>

<h3 id="heroku">Heroku?</h3>

<p>At this point you probably want to push this to awesome thing to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> to
start get VC funding. This is easy to do (the pushing part).</p>

<p>First create your heroku app in the usual manner (at the time of this writing
you don’t even need to choose the cedar stack - but check the docs to make
sure you are Clojure compatible).</p>

<p>Now create a <code>Procfile</code> with the following contents:</p>

<pre><code>web: lein with-profile production trampoline run -m defclink.main $PORT
</code></pre>

<p>Now you should be able to push to Heroku and sit back waiting for the funding
to roll in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>“When you find yourself in a hole, quit digging”
– Will Rogers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes I wonder what the important skills for a developer are.  I now
believe that one of the important ones (perhaps most important) is knowing
how/when to give up and start again. This contradicts another important
skill/trait for a developer to have: tenacity. But I think they are balancing
forces with giving up being slightly more important. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Often when working on a problem, it takes longer; is more complicated and
difficult than expected. At this point there are many files modified and it
looks like there are many more to modify; plenty of broken tests, maybe an
unknown quantity. There are two options: keep going, or give up.</p>

<p>This is the point I like to remind myself (and my coworkers) of Will Rogers
quote. Another thing I do is ask “Are we digging a tunnel, or a hole?” If we
think we are digging a tunnel then we can give ourself a time limit for
further digging; if it pays off – great! otherwise we need to climb out of
the hole.</p>

<p>I used to believe, quite strongly, that tenacity was more important. To
persevere through the mountain of outstanding changes and get it done was
admirable.  I now believe that giving up is the better option. What changed my
mind? I now see more benefit in taking the knowledge acquired from the work
done and reapply it to the problem from a fresh start. Powering through the
situation is deciding at the current way is the only way; starting again is
deciding that there is a different way, with the knowledge that the current
way has giving you (which is at least that the current way isn’t working out).</p>

<hr />

<p>As a footnote I want to add that I also thinking giving up in another way is
important. When working on something collaboratively (such as when pairing)
one can find oneself at odds with another developer about how to proceed. I
believe that unless the idea is very obviously bad that to stop
arguing/discussing and do <em>something</em> is better that spending time discussing.
Especially when there is source code involved - any code is better than no
code. Any code, can then be changed into better code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the interest in breaking my current blogging writing block I’ll record for
posterity my ‘recipe’ for chicken soup.</p>

<p>First you need to eat some chicken so you have bones. I usually get rotisserie
chickens for another recipe (Skillet Chicken Pot Pie) and then save the
bones in the freezer. I use two carcasses for this recipe.</p>

<p>So take the bones and entomb them in a big pot with some carrots, celery,
garlic and onion. Don’t worry about chopping up the vegetables or even peeling
them - this step is making stock.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/8732668241/" title="Look at the bones!"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7286/8732668241_6e4ae3c78d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Look at the bones!" /></a></p>

<p>(The clever ones among you will note that I didn’t tell you how much of these
things to put in. I am doing this in honor of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/4309417102/">mother</a> on this
Mother’s Day.)</p>

<p>Now put in enough water to drown it all…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/8732668733/" title="Now with water"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/8732668733_30888ab230.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Now with water" /></a></p>

<p>and bring it to a boil.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/8732669071/" title="Starting to Simmer"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7296/8732669071_920961006f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Starting to Simmer" /></a></p>

<p>Let it boil for as long as you can stand to. You want it to get all the good
tastes out of the chicken bones and vegetables. I usually let it go for 2-4
hours and stir it occasionally. I don’t let it boil down more than half-way
however.</p>

<p>At this point it should be filling up your house with a very
delicious aroma.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/8732669473/" title="Boiling down"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7285/8732669473_99a9d98ebe.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Boiling down" /></a></p>

<p>After boiling it down you need to strain out all the solid bits and throw them
away. I have not included a picture of this because it looks rather unpleasant
and might put you off the recipe. But take my word for it - this bit of
unpleasantness will be worth it.</p>

<p>What you have now is chicken stock. Do with it what you will!</p>

<p>I usually choose to turn right around and create soup. I now put in carrots,
celery, onion, garlic, maybe peas. These, since you will be eating them should
be peeled, cleaned, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/8732669819/" title="Now making it into soup"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7308/8732669819_46a1cabb11.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Now making it into soup" /></a></p>

<p>I usually, because I am lazy, add a pasta to this soup, but potato or rice
could be used instead.</p>

<p>Bon Appetit!

  <div class="entry-content"><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>As everyone that knows me knows, I have become enamored with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail">cocktails</a>.</p>

<p>So I thought, with that amazing hubris encapsulated within the novice, I would
tell you, the reader, how to stock a bar if you are new to cocktails yourself.</p>

<p>I’ll split this amateur’s amateur guide into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Equipment</li>
  <li>The Drink</li>
  <li>The Practice</li>
  <li>The Expansion</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-equipment">The Equipment</h1>

<p>I will start by listing the equipment you need. This will seem like a lot; but
you can find some of it in ‘kits’ which will help you get started (replacing
crappy items as you realize that there are better tools).</p>

<ul>
  <li>a jigger<sup id="fnref:jigger"><a href="#fn:jigger" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>a shaker set. (I prefer a Boston Shaker<sup id="fnref:bostonshaker"><a href="#fn:bostonshaker" class="footnote">2</a></sup>)</li>
  <li>a strainer (such as a Hawthorne Strainer<sup id="fnref:strainer"><a href="#fn:strainer" class="footnote">3</a></sup>)</li>
  <li>a bar spoon<sup id="fnref:barspoon"><a href="#fn:barspoon" class="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>This seems like a lot of stuff - but like I said you can find it in ‘kits’. If
you can get better tools from a specialty store (such as <a href="http://www.thebostonshaker.com/">The Boston Shaker</a>).</p>

<h1 id="the-drink">The Drink</h1>

<p>You should start with one or two drinks you like and that have only a few
ingredients. For example a Manhattan or Negroni only have 3 ingredients; a Gin
and Tonic only two (three if you count the lime). Pick drinks you really like
because you will be making them a lot.  It also helps if you pick drinks with
‘standard’ ingredients, like Gin, Vodka, Rye, Bourbon, Whisky, Campari etc.
This makes it easier to buy these ingredients from your local liquor store.</p>

<h1 id="the-practice">The Practice</h1>

<p>Now that you have the equipment and the ingredients; make yourself a drink –
you deserve it! Then make it again, and again, and again…</p>

<p>As you practice, you’ll figure out how to measure (and when you don’t care
about measuring), you’ll figure out how to stir or shake well, how much ice
you might need etc.</p>

<h1 id="the-expansion">The Expansion</h1>

<p>Once you have gotten good a drink (or perhaps sick of it) look for a drink
which has all the same ingredients but in different proportions; or a drink
that has a different ingredient you don’t have yet.</p>

<p>In this way your repertoire will grow and your skill will as well.</p>

<p>Hippocrates noted that there was so much to his craft to learn, but only such
a short life to learn it in<sup id="fnref:hippo"><a href="#fn:hippo" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Chaucer paraphrased it as <em>‘Life is so

<p>While I can totally relate to that idea these days I didn’t always. At one
point I was a foolish person who thought they were good at what they did and
just slid along, month after month, year upon year not improving. That changed
several years ago when I was introduced to a bunch of new (to me) ideas and
techniques and the scales fell from my eyes and I realized how little I knew.</p>

<p>I feel I know so little sometimes; that my skills as a developer are limited.
I know that is not entirely true, my self-deprecation rearing its ugly head.
But it is a frequent feeling.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> so much to learn and one’s life <em>is</em> so short; why then should I
even bother? I enjoy programming, and I, as part of my character, prefer to do
the best job I can. Thus I am left with no choice but to do everything I can
to improve my skills.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> so much to learn and one’s life <em>is</em> so short; how then can I move
forward? I have been focusing on the basics (such as simple design and clean
code) - these will be skills applicable to any programming language I may use
or project I may be on. From this base I can expand into areas which are less
familiar to me (such as functional and logic programming) - these will broaden
the mind and help clarify existing skills in the familiar areas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Whilst fixing some bugs in data file parsing code I found that the bugs lie in
the fact that the types of data files were more similar than not; but the code
said that they were more dissimilar than similar. Refactoring to make same
code same fixed at least part of the bugs on its own.</p>

<h2 id="a-story">A Story</h2>

<p>On my current project we have some code that reads data files and puts the
data into the database. The files come in different formats and layouts,
however there are only really two different kinds of files. I have always
maintained that the processing of these two types of files are more same than
different. <em>i.e.</em> How to read an excel file with the data laid out <em>just so</em>
and put that data into the database is all the same whereas the way to
validate if <em>this</em> line in the file a data line or something to ignore, or how
to split all the data into larger logical chunks (required before putting into
the database) is perhaps different between these two types of files.</p>

<p>I was very involved in the creation of the code for the reading of the first
type of data file; but not very involved for the second. Recently when we
shook out some bugs in the parsing of the second type of file I found myself
in the code for both types of files fixing the bugs.</p>

<p>I found that the code implied that the two files were more different than I
had imagined. Code that I thought would be similar or even exactly the same
was not. This difference could be seen on multiple levels; from the naming of
things up to the factoring of the code into methods and classes.</p>

<p>As I reviewed the bugs I had to fix I saw that the bugs were stating that the
second type of file was in fact not so different from the first type. As far
as the user was concerned much of the “rules” of parsing were exactly the
same.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was make the code for the second type of file much more
similar to the first type. This involved renaming and refactoring. Then once
things were much more the same I extracted the sameness into the base class
(which had already existed). By doing this refactoring at least parts of the
bugs were fixed. All that was left was some tweaking to the code left behind
which defined the <em>difference</em>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This coding really showed to me the importance of keeping a consistency in the
code. Things which are the same should be named and look the same. Things
which are different should <em>NOT</em> named the same or look the same; they must be
kept dissimilar.  The compiler doesn’t care of course; but I think it will
help the programmer.</p>

<p>Not keeping to this ‘rule’ I think will lead to bugs where things which should
be the handled in the same or similar manner are mistakenly not since they
appear to the following developers to be different. Or even more simply
because the commonality was not extracted earlier because it was not noticed.</p>

<p>The way to keep this in mind is not not just think if the code is factored
well or has good naming; but also if the code you wrote is similar or
dissimilar to other code around it - and if that is correct or not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I visited <a href="https://twitter.com/BrickMortarLtd">Brick and Mortar</a> before Thanksgiving for a Sazerac
and to let Lisa know that I’d be in on Monday with the
<a href="https://twitter.com/codeandcocktail">Code-and-Cocktails</a> group. She pointed to a cocktail on
their menu she thought I might like.  <a href="https://twitter.com/hankyp">Misty</a> came over after my
Sazerac was done and I ordered it; since it had [Chartreuse][chartreuse] in it
I decided to ask her what the differences, if any, there were between Green
and Yellow Chartreuse. Turns out there are a bunch of differences and Misty
was quite happy to tell me about them. I asked if I could have a taste of each
to compare and she obliged.</p>

<p>I’m bad at describing tastes but I can say that Yellow Chartreuse is sweeter
and not as strong, the Green is a stronger Liqueur and not as sweet, more
herbal.</p>

<p>After this experiment I decided I needed to get some and add more drinks to my
home repertoire. After buying it I pinged Misty on twitter and asked for a
recommendation for a drink combining gin, or rye, or vermouth (my staples)
with the Chartreuse. She pointed me at the Bijou. The recipe she gave me was:
equal parts gin, chartreuse and sweet vermouth (I did 1oz), a dash of orange
bitters and lemon oil garnishing.</p>

<p>The taste was very complicated and very good. Chartreuse is something I am
going to continue to explore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/4309417102/">Mother’s</a> Kartoffelsalat (Potato Salad) recipe is a German style
potato salad; not one with mayonnaise. This is the type I grew up with and I
think the other type is just <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>One day many years ago I asked my mother from the recipe and she gave it to
me. Trouble was - she didn’t have any measurements. It was all done by how
much seemed good. I present the recipe to you in the same way.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Potatoes. Boiled until they are cooked through - but not mushy. Cut up
potatoes if some are much bigger than others (so they cook evenly). Then
sliced into approx 1/4” slices. Peeling is optional.</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Vinegar</li>
  <li>Salt &amp; Pepper</li>
  <li>Onion - chopped</li>
  <li>Garlic - minced</li>
  <li>(optional) Bacon - cut into little pieces and cooked crisp.</li>
  <li>(optional) Cucumber - sliced very thin.</li>
</ul>

<p>I usually make it with 5lbs of potatoes (because I am bringing it to
Thanksgiving dinner for example). For that much potato 1-2 onions will be good
and something like a tablespoon of garlic (hard to have too much for me).</p>

<p>After slicing the potatoes while still hot and adding garlic and onion put in
oil and vinegar - make sure the potatoes are well coated. I like it to be a
bit sour so I make sure there is a bit more vinegar than oil.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>Can be served warm after cooking or cold, or reheated in a microwave, or fried
up in a pan (Papa did that one time when Mama was in the hospital and I was
still pretty young).</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Just a quick post about chapters 14 &amp; 15 of GOOS to get myself back into the
swing of things after a while…)</p>

<p>A few points hit me during these two chapters. Things which I <em>know</em> but which
perhaps are not entirely second nature to me yet (even after all these years)</p>

<ul>
  <li>In chapter 14 new features were added with little fuss - the relatively
clean design allowed for this.</li>
  <li>Chapter 15 showed doing refactorings bit by bit - it kept tests red for a
while but they got done. Just because it will take a while doesn’t mean not
    to do it.</li>
  <li>Chapter 15 also saw the developers thinking about how to continue down the
path they were one was going to be pretty annoying/boring. They took this
to mean that they were doing something wrong. They stopped and thought
about it and found a better design which allowed their needed changes to be
easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are three important things to internalize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good clean design leads to ease in implementing new features.</li>
  <li>A refactoring might be hard - but that is not a reason not to do it.</li>
  <li>If the change you need to do is hard / annoying - step back and figure out
why (see the first point).</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all things I <em>know</em>; but in the heat of the moment will tend to
forget. I need to really get them internalized; then I can <em>choose</em> to ignore
them at certain circumstances, but then I’ll do it more explicitly and know
the pros and cons.</p>

<p>Also as a side note there were some good points where the OO design skills
shone through. For example the addition of Java <code>enum</code> objects which quickly
became feature-ful objects which caused cleaner code elsewhere (<code>Column</code> and
<code>SniperState</code>)</p>
