  <div class="entry-content"><p>In normal mythology the far past golden-age was an age when people were <br />stronger, more beautiful and intelligent than they are now. We have <br />diminished over time. <p /> With D&amp;D it is the opposite:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In 1974 D&amp;D heroes had +1 bonuses if they were lucky. You got d6 hit <br /> points and you were happy (pretty good for the magic user actually). <br /> Everything did d6 damage. Magic was smaller and rarer - there was no <br /> such thing as Magic Missile. Clerics didn't even get a spell until <br /> second level and getting to second level was hard! <p />  * In AD&amp;D they could get +3, or even the the amazing +3/+6 with 18/00 <br /> STR. Fighters got d10 hit points and it was amazing! Magic was more awesome, but still not everyone had it. <p />  * In 2nd edition characters got SKILLS! Clerics had powers <p />  * In 3rd edition characters had /FEATS/! It was like everyone got a <br /> bit of magic now! And people started talking about BUYING magic <br /> items - those things were for sale now in game worlds! <p />  * In 4th edition - this is the golden age. First level characters have <br /> double digit hip points and do massive damage. There are lots of <br /> 'magical' abilities for everyone. I'm sure the local beggars have <br /> some sort of daily begging powers or something. Everyone is studly <br /> and puissant. <p /> Thus D&amp;D is the opposite of mythology in a way. But also in a way I <br />think we may have still diminished a little along the way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(warning: an odd half-formed thought is contained herein[1])</p>

<ol>
<li>Yaweh let Adam name all the creatures in the world &ndash; this gave Adam
dominion over all the creatures.[2]</li>
<li>Medieval magicians believed that knowing the <em>name</em> of a thing would
give them power over that thing.[3]</li>
</ol>


<p>In software development we name things to keep tabs on them. To get a
handle on them. Without a name we can&rsquo;t refer to things &mdash; we can&rsquo;t move
things around &mdash; we can&rsquo;t organize them.</p>

<p>More importantly: to have the <strong>true name</strong> of a thing allows one to
have absolute control over it. Without the true name we don&rsquo;t have full
power.</p>

<p>Naming seems to be a special case of the power of language. With
language we have the power to communicate, to do things collaboratively.
Names let us do actions to things, and to collaborate on those actions.</p>

<p>Footnotes:</p>

<p>[1] In a discussion on Naming in the context of Software Craftsmanship I
made an odd statement linking naming in software with medieval magic and
the naming of all the creatures from the Judeo-Christian Genesis myth.
I thought I could expand it slightly here.</p>

<p>[2]  A mashup of the two Genesis myths (1:36 &amp; 2:20).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is what a completed century looks like:
<img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6135/5924325779_8759bf2911_d.jpg" alt="DONE" /> Everything else are just details.</p>

<p>The dramatis personae of this story are: a 40 year old male:
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2699/4419808164_7710801f44_d.jpg" alt="myself" /> and a 39
year-old lady
<img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5231/5901903172_fb4fbe78b7_d.jpg" alt="Gale" /></p>

<p>The trip was approximately[1] the following <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Central+Square,+Cambridge,+MA+02139&amp;daddr=Salem,+MA+to:42.55182,-70.83646+to:Town+of+Manchester-by-the-Sea,+Manchester-by-the-Sea,+MA+to:Magnolia,+Gloucester,+MA+to:Gloucester,+MA+to:Rockport,+MA&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=42.54388,-70.87364&amp;spn=0.011066,0.022681&amp;sll=42.552132,-70.837462&amp;sspn=0.011065,0.022681&amp;geocode=FZlxhgIdFwjD-ynpwOBIUXfjiTFLx8G9sLwZUg%3BFfTLiAIdtDPG-ym3VvhqZGnjiTFFWaWlorjggQ%3BFQxKiQIdFB_H-yn72FRgbRbjiTHZHwtnQNugJw%3BFYKtiQIdqzrI-ynF6Iek4jzjiTGLmKUWhIum3w%3BFYufiQIduArJ-yk1ORclXjvjiTESuOi5ACYccw%3BFXhEigIdm8jJ-ykxAHOGgiTjiTHtwm8wq7fV6g%3BFaPfigIdXmvK-yk77KC7jSPjiTHxfw2gWoFWOQ&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrsp=2&amp;sz=16&amp;via=2&amp;dirflg=b&amp;z=16&amp;lci=bike">route</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that it ended up being a Century was a bit of a self-trick on
my part.  I planned on the trip to Salem and <em>maybe</em> further.  Of course
when i got to Salem I felt great (only 15-20 miles) so I went off to
Manchester-by-the-sea; and still felt great so off to Gloucester etc.
Thus after 50 miles I was standing on the train platform in Rockport
looking at the sign: <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6003/5924887054_1d3a343d06_d.jpg" alt="Inbound to Boston" />
and thinking &ndash; yes, time to head back.</p>

<p>Along the way I saw some lovely sea-sides, like the dock at Rockport
where Gale posed for me <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6138/5924886428_b7d0c5681b_d.jpg" alt="Gale at the water's edge" />
and Independence Beach in Beverly: <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/5924319663_7555c2667e_d.jpg" alt="Left Side" />
<img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6150/5924320097_6b037ccecc_d.jpg" alt="Right Side" />
Also somewhere, I passed this lovely marsh: <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6018/5924883828_043be25cbc_d.jpg" alt="a lovely marsh" /></p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t all lovely however, the roads were not always pleasant, the
hills steep, and the pilgrims unfriendly: <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6022/5924318777_86f9b256e4_d.jpg" alt="Conant disapproves of this frivolous travel on a Sunday!" /></p>

<p>Salem,
where I took my longest stop in either direction seemed to have only one
bike rack in the center of town <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5924887538_d82fa62e34_d.jpg" alt="The official Salem Bike Rack(tm)" />
The sad monuments in Gloucester made me remember the loved one I left
behind when I &ldquo;[went] down to the sea [by bike]&rdquo; <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6127/5924884680_fe021859fb_d.jpg" alt="Loved ones left behind" />
<img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6128/5924323029_f6a268ef9b_d.jpg" alt="They that go down to the sea in ships" /></p>

<p>In the end it was a great trip.  The day was lovely and I managed not to back down from the challenge. I set myself a goal of riding a century this year and have done it.  It&rsquo;s very good to know that I <strong>can</strong> set myself a goal and carry it out.  I hope to take this knowledge and remind myself of it when I hit low points in my other goals/projects.</p>

<p>Footnotes:</p>

<p>[1] (I say approximately since I took several wrong turns here and there (more like wrong straight-ons-when-should-have-turned-s) but that luckily found a slightly nicer track right when I got into Beverly by going on Lothrop Street which led me along the water.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content">On Saturday (2011-06-18) I set out for a 50 mile ride. I was going to <br />do my 'usual' loop[1] backwards (/e.g./ home -> Norumbega -> Walden -> <br />Concord -> Bedford -> Lexington -> Home (plus something more to fill in <br />extra mileage). It did not turn out as expected... <p /> For one, it was cuter than expected. I saw a total of 10 chipmunks[2] <br />(3 suicidal), 1 groundhog, a serene black-and-white cat sitting on a log <br />in the woods and 1 duck with bevy of ducklings paddling along in a <br />culvert. That along with the usual set of squirrels and birds made for <br />a high cute-level of the ride. <p /> Secondly the ride was longer than expected. I was 6-7 miles short when <br />I stopped off at home to refresh my water and make some. I decided to <br />take the loop around the Charles, boring, but would be easy enough - <br />even with the remnants of Bruins fans littering the ground. However <br />when 50 showed up on my odometer I decided to press on - I was feeling <br />pretty good[3]. In all I rode 62.39 miles. That put me just into the <br />100km territory - thus I have unlocked my next 'achievement': Metric <br />Century. <p /> One other oddity of this ride: tourists at the Norumbega tower. I was <br />sitting there at my first way-point sipping my coffee when they arrived <br />in two cars and came up and started reading the plaque. As I prepared <br />to leave I told them about the plaque at Mt. Auburn Hospital and the <br />Lief Erikson statue on the Commonwealth Mall. Then they asked what else <br />I knew about this odd guy - thus I became briefly a sort of tour-guide <br />for New England's bogus Viking heritage. I am annoyed with myself that <br />I never asked them what brought them to the tower however. <p /> Trip Statistics: <br /> * Miles: 62.39 <br /> * Riding Time: 5:38:44 <br /> * Total Time: (uh... more...) <br /> * Average Speed: ~11mph <p /> I am quite pleasantly surprised that even after such a long ride my <br />knees/legs/butt is doing pretty well. Right after the ride I was pretty <br />beat, and the next day as well my knees (especially the right) <br />complained about stairs. Now on the 2nd day after there seems to be no <br />problems and riding my bike today felt great. A hundred miles seems <br />very doable given time in the day. I'm going to do a few more 62 mile <br />runs and at least one 75 before I do my Century. I might be able to do <br />it as early as September which might make a great thing to do for my <br />birthday. <p /> Footnotes: [1] Here usual means the route I've taken twice before. <p /> [2] They must have been metric chipmunks since on average they appeared <br />1 per 10km <p /> [3] Of course about a mile later, one knee and the opposite calf <br />started complaining. Typical.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Norumbega is a mythical place, a sort of place holder name for unknown
locations in the New England area[1].  Today I biked there, battling
thunderstorms, mobs of Steampunk cosplayers[2], and mechanical failures[3], to
the dark, abandoned, closed tower which is the lonely outpost of the
area&rsquo;s long lost Viking past.</p>

<p>Eben Norton Horsford[4] held the Rumford Chair of the Application of
Science to the Useful Arts at Harvard in the late 1840&rsquo;s[5].  He later
founded the Rumford Chemical Works and produced an improved recipe for
baking powder. This baking powder is still being produced as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/5696817133/in/set-72157626544381657">Rumford
Baking
Powder</a>.
He also held the controversial[6] idea that Lief Erikson[7] sailed up
the Charles River, as far as Waltham (near present day Brandeis
University) and ultimately building a house in Cambridge.</p>

<p>I decided that I would trace Leif&rsquo;s trip up Charles River, Gale would be
my longship and we&rsquo;d brave all trials and tribulations we might find
along the way.</p>

<p>The expedition started as all good expeditions do with a good
breakfast (in this case supplied by my lovely wife Wendy who cooked some
delicious pancakes[8]), and the laying in of supplies (16oz of
Clover&trade; brewed New Guinea coffee put into my thermos from the local
Starbucks).  With these preliminaries completed I started my fateful
trip.</p>

<p>Stopping first to contemplate the location of Lief Erikson&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>It lay just outside the back of Mt. Auburn Hospital, I wondered just
what this spot must have looked like in the year 1000 BCE; probably less
traffic.</p>

<p>From there I started the long ride up the river to my next destination.
I had not before ridden so far up the river (usually just stopping at
Watertown dam).  I took several wrong turns because I didn&rsquo;t know how
the &ldquo;Blue Heron&rdquo;[9] path ran so I missed it in a few places; and worse
turned in the wrong direction entirely when part of it turned out to be
closed in Waltham.  The clouds were rolling in and so was the thunder, I
was worried that I was going to be caught in the rain and I had not yet
found the tower. Riding through Mt. Feake Cemetery the rain caught up
with me.  Through the cemetery quickly and then ducking into the
Brandeis-Roberts train stop I hoped to wait out the rain.  I sipped some
coffee and waited.  The rain continued but it looked like it was
brightening.  Checking my map I knew I was close to the tower.  I
decided that the rain was lightening up so I recounted for the final
stretch.</p>

<p>Mother Nature, that fickle woman, was up to her usual tricks and mere
moments later I was soaked as the rain quickly got worse.  I pressed on
to the tower and was pleasantly surprised to find it much easier to find
than expected.</p>

<p>The tower marks the location where there had been a Norse
fort/city[10] according to Horsford.</p>

 Tower" /></p>

<p>At one point it seemed that the public could climb the inside of the
tower to enjoy the view from the top, but now it was all blocked off
with welded in gates.  Some of them had been broken/pulled off but the
holes were not big enough for me to enter but I could still contemplate
the dark mysteries that might have been hidden within.</p>

 lurks" /></p>

<p>The rain was fluctuating in intensity and since I was already wet I
decided to just start heading back.  For the first five or so miles I
held out the hope that the rain would stop and the sun would come back
out. After that I gave up that hope.  I was so wet that stopping to get
out of the rain would be useless. I probably would be drying if I had
jumped /into/ the Charles River. I even decided to ride /past/ home to
finish this expedition.</p>

<p>My final stop before turning to home was the Lief Erikson statue at the
beginning of the Commonwealth Avenue Mall.</p>

 Statue" /></p>

<p>Having attained pictures of the statue, I hoped back into my longship
and rode it over the Harvard Bridge[11] into Cambridge and finally home.</p>

<p>The expedition, though wet, was a success.  Total ride length: 31.21
miles.  Total ride time: 3:00:22[12].</p>

<p>All pictures, in full size, of my ride are available on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/">flick

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>(a half-baked thought)</em></p>

<p>In a <a href="http://code-and-cocktails.herokuapp.com/blog/2011/04/13/how-i-learned-agile-all-wrong-and-still-ended-up-liking-it/">previous post</a> I realized that to me TDD has a little bit
of the same feel as working in a REPL. When I first learned the technique it
really clicked for me since I always preferred what i referred to as
<em>exploratory</em> coding, that is, cycles of trying out little changes and moving
toward the solution of the whole problem.</p>

<p>In a language with a REPL this exploratory coding is pretty normal. It is very
natural to try something, <strong>play</strong> with ideas, and periodically save off the
code you want. Without a REPL and TDD the cycle is slower, which leads to
making larger changes since the cost of small changes is so high. Without a
REPL, but with TDD, the cycles can be kept pretty short: short cycles of unit
tests, longer cycles of integration and end-to-end testing.</p>

<p>So TDD gives one the ability to try out ideas quickly like in a REPL. It is
not as good as a REPL.  Of course TDD has other effects so the fact it is not
a REPL is made up for. But, to me, the benefit of being able to <em>play</em> with
ideas, trying lots of things, saving the good and discarding the bad should
not be forgotten.</p>

<p>As an example of this sort of REPL/TDD based play I offer <a href="http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com/michael_feathers_blog/2011/01/the-string-calculator-kata-in-haskell.html">this video</a> 
from Mike Feathers doing the <a href="http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/">String Calculator</a> kata in Haskell.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Up until several years ago I only knew one way to do a software project.
The “usual” way: Requirements document; bunch of coding; deadlines which
were basically impossible; throwing the app at QA; thrashing to “improve
quality”; sending it to the customer and then “firefighting” to fix the
fact that it didn’t meet the requirements.  Sure there were glimpse of
other ways; small changes to the process etc.; but generally the same.</p>

<p>Then I learned about “Agile”. (I fully intend those quotes). The company
I worked for was bought by another larger company. That company seems to
have had a team which “went Agile” from the bottom up and the company
decided that it was going to be the “new way”. I was one of the
“important people” who was on the new project which was going to be one
of the flagship “Agile” projects.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-was-taught">What I Was Taught</h2>

<p>We got two(ish) days of consulting. We were taught story writing,
planning poker, iterations, QA in-iteration, and some TDD examples (damn
Bowling Game). The impression I <em>got</em> was that we’d be working in close
teams, prioritizing every iteration (because requirements are always
changing), working hard to produce only the code we need (and do it
cleanly), release this frequently to get quick feedback. I also was
“taught” the “don’t do design” idea.  I know several of my team members
feel they heard the same.</p>

<p>I thought this was <strong>AWESOME</strong>. I drank the Kool-Aid and then went back for
a second cup.</p>

<p>I worked to learn more and more. The company sent me to Agile2008, and I
I took myself to Agile2009. I went to other conferences, I read books,
blogs, I went to meetups and talked with people.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>

<p>I learned many things, sometimes the hard way, not all direct lessons.</p>

<p>I learned that “going Agile” isn’t going to work unless people want to
give it a try. Imposing “Agile” from above won’t work. The people
involved need to want to at least try it. Most important of course is
the by-in from management in and above the team.</p>

<p>I learned, and am still learning, ways to help teach and learn from my
coworkers. At first, being very gung-ho about it, I came off a bit too
“you’re doing it wrong!” and that turned people off and probably burned
a few bridges that could have been useful later.</p>

<p>I learned that having QA in-iteration, or even better, “pairing” with QA
on the tests (automated or manual) for a story is very powerful and can
flush out issues (potential or realized) quickly.</p>

<p>I learned that the “don’t design” idea doesn’t work. (I probably wasn’t
intentionally taught that, but I really feel that it came out during our
training. Perhaps an overemphasis on not getting attached to an up-front
design and letting TDD take its course.)  I initially tried it, while my
coworkers rejected it, and TDD, without trying it.  I think by trying -
and not succeeding - at it I have become better at what amount of design
is needed, and how TDD can lead to good designs (at least at the micro
level).</p>

<p>I learned that my ideas about OO design were not good. I was mostly
just doing imperative programming in big bags of loosely related things
I called <em>classes</em>.</p>

<p>I learned that clean code is flexible and can be easy to understand and
make changes to. I learned that I had a LOT more to learn about writing
clean code.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-like">What I Like</h2>

<p>I love the idea of transparency. This was not taught. I learned it own
my own and I feel it is one of the most important things about “Agile”
and wonder why it is not presented more.  It can be scary, very scary,
not to be able to hide behind the buffered schedule, or the layers of
management, but in the end I think it is better to be open and up-front
about everything going on in a project.  If there are problems it is
best to get them out in the open earlier, so that they can be addressed
earlier (when it is generally easier to address them).</p>

<p>I like working incrementally. Working on small stories in time-boxed
iterations help me to keep focused.  Each iteration I have to make sure
that we have a (at least potentially) releasable product. I learned long
ago that today’s new product is tomorrow’s maintenance product. So
bringing out the maintenance problems by practicing the release every
iteration brings out the maintenance problems sooner.</p>

<p>I like working with in-iteration QA. Being able to work with these
professionals closely helps me ensure my code does what it needs to do,
does what it should, and most importantly doesn’t do anything else. It
also gives me quick feedback.</p>

<p>I like quick feedback, always have (but I had forgotten over
time). Quick feedback helps me focus on what is needed and keep the aim
true. If the aim is off we know faster and adjustments can be made. Also
obviously easier to fix issues found sooner than later.</p>

<p>I love TDD. Plain and simple. It took me a little while, but after being
taught the TDD technique, I realized I knew it. I used to call that sort
of programming “exploratory”. When I had a REPL, I coded by trying
something out, testing, playing; then I’d save it and test the larger
chunk. This would be repeated. Without a REPL I’d do it in a larger
slower edit-compile-debug cycles.</p>

<p>Finally, I like how what I have learned has moved me to much produce
much cleaner code. I still have much to learn here. But the “stressors”
of repeated frequent releases, evolving requirements, and TDD have
pushed me to write, IMHO, much better code. It has also driven me to
think outside the imperative and OO paradigms.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-still-want-to-learn">What I Still Want to Learn</h2>

<p>I do still need to learn much more about producing the best code I
can. Also to keep in mind that the “best code” must also be the “right
code” - it must provide the features needed.</p>

<p>I still need to learn some “people” things. I need to learn how to
better learn from, and teach people.</p>

<p>And most importantly I have learned I need to learn much more.</p>
