  <div class="entry-content"><p>The balancing act between delivering vs. code quality has been on my mind
lately. It seems to me that there are times when delivery trumps code quality.
But sacrificing code quality for delivery speed results in slower delivery of
future features.</p>

<p>(‘Code Quality’ here is defined as ‘good design’, ‘easy to change’, ‘easy to
understand’. This is not about quality as in free-of-bugs: that is <strong>not</strong> a
corner I will cut. I am also not suggesting writing <em>shit</em>.)</p>

<p>Are there any corners which are <em>safe</em> to cut? I have a feeling there is no
good answer; but is there a <em>right</em> answer?</p>

<p>I suppose as a bottom line the best to do is to keep the corner-cutting
explicit and visible to all people involved (that includes non-developers) so
that the eventual slowdown will not be a surprise.</p>

<p>Or is this just an invalid assumption on my part? Is there any time that
delivery can trump code quality? I know that everyone says that keeping code
quality high is the only way to go quickly
(<a href="http://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">@unclebob’s</a> pithy: “The only way to go
fast is to go well”). But that seems to be to be about the long term; I am
talking about short term speed gains.</p>

<p>This is something I’m going to continue to think about; I’d love to hear your
thoughts on this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just sat in on a talk by Cory Foy entitled “When Code Cries: Listening to What
Your Code is Saying”.</p>

<p>(Warning: there will be anthropomorphizing of source code in this post)</p>

<p>One thing I wanted to pull out of it is the idea of <em>listening</em> to your code.
Really listening. Like it was a person.</p>

<p>I don’t think it is just listening to code - but a conversation with code. The
programmer is talking about what they need, and the code is telling the
programmer what it needs. It is a give and take like any conversation. If one
side of the conversation tries to dominate, or ignores the other, the outcome
will not be successful. Like any conversation the failure may not be immediate
but later when misunderstandings between the parties of the conversation cause
problems.</p>

<p>Listening is not easy however. To really listen you have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decide to listen</li>
  <li>Listen for the whole message</li>
  <li>Let go of your personal agenda</li>
  <li>Be patient</li>
  <li>Be curious</li>
  <li>Test for understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>I personally have problems with listening patiently for the whole message.  I
tend to jump in, trying to add things, perhaps of my own agenda, saying things
starting with “So what you’re saying is…” instead of just waiting to find
out what is being said. With code this comes out when I too quickly jump to
refactorings or thinking that my coding task is done - because I’m not
listening to the code.</p>

<p>Having a conversation with code is not easy either. Mike Clement
<a href="https://twitter.com/mdclement">@mdclement</a> likened it to talking with his 18
month old child. They can’t talk - but they are trying to communicate. One
needs to be patient in order to get the message.</p>

<p>I am working on being a better listener, with people, but I can see that I
need to work on those skills for my code as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The following is the recipe for “Washabinaros Chili”, we found it on
<a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/washabinaros-chili">All Recipes</a>. It
serves 8.</p>

<p>The startling parts of the recipe which always attract people’s
attention when I describe it is the wasabi paste, the beer and the
coffee.</p>

<p>The recipe is not difficult but takes time. The prepping can take
20-30 minutes, and the total cooking time is 3 hours. However it is
worth the time.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>4 tbl vegetable oil, divide</li>
  <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
  <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
  <li>3/4 lb spicy Italian sausage, casing removed</li>
  <li>14.5 oz peeled/diced tomatoes with juice</li>
  <li>12 oz dark beer</li>
  <li>1 cup strong brewed coffee</li>
  <li>12 oz tomato paste</li>
  <li>14 oz beef broth</li>
  <li>1/4 cup chili powder</li>
  <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 tbl ground cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
  <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tblspn wasabi paste</li>
  <li>45 oz kidney beans</li>
  <li>2 Anaheim chili peppers, chopped</li>
  <li>1 Serrano chili pepper, chopped</li>
  <li>1 Habenero pepper, sliced</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Place 2 tblsp oil in large pot over medium heat</li>
  <li>Cook &amp; stir onions, garlic, beef &amp; sausage until meats are tender</li>
  <li>Pour in tomatoes, coffee, beer, tomato paste &amp; broth</li>
  <li>Season with chili powder, cumin, sugar, oregano, cayenne,
coriander, salt &amp; wasabi.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1/3 of the beans, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover &amp;
simmer.</li>
  <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the remaining oil.</li>
  <li>Cook the chilies in the oil until just tender, 5-10 min.</li>
  <li>Add peppers to pot and simmer 2 hours.</li>
  <li>Add remaining beans &amp; cook for additional 45 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>We use mostly Chipolte chili powder in this recipe, it really adds a
great taste and kick.</p>

<p>Also pick a good dark beer, a really ‘chewy’ stout. The last time I
made it I used
<a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18371/54019">Babayaga Stout by Pretty Things</a>. Of course enjoy the rest of the bottle while cooking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was prompted by <a href="http://proctorit.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/latex-in-wordpress/">Steven Proctor’s post</a> about using
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/"><script type="math/tex">\LaTeX</script></a> on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> to see if it could be done on
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">Octopress</a>. Of course it can!</p>

<p>A quick googling turned up a <a href="http://panchoat.org/blog/2012/06/03/latex-support-of-octopress/">Eason’s Blog</a> about doing just this.
His post links to <a href="http://chen.yanping.me/cn/blog/2012/03/10/octopress-with-latex/">another</a> which is in Chinese but the code
snippets are all you need. Note that Eason’s post points out that <code>config.yml</code>
needs to be updated… something left out of the other.</p>

<p>(Also a note: leave a blank line above the <code>$$</code> starting a multi-line
<script type="math/tex">\LaTeX</script> block for best results.)</p>

<p>And now for a test</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)

      & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
            \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
                  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
                        \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
                            \end{array} \right)
        \left( \begin{array}{c}
              y_1 \\
                    \vdots \\
                          y_n
                              \end{array} \right)
        \end{align*} %]]></script>

<p>Looks pretty good.</p>

<p>I think Knuth would be pleased.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="0-background">0. Background</h2>

<p>About a year ago I read McCarthy’s paper <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf">“Recursive Functions of Symbolic
Expressions and Their Computation by Machine</a> and I thought about
implementing the Lisp described in it in Ruby (a language I was learning at
the time). The project languished for quite some time until just recently when
I went ahead and implemented the language specification laid out in that
paper.</p>

<p>The project is <a href="http://github.com/verdammelt/yarlisp">yarlisp</a>, it’s name means “Yet Another Ruby Lisp” given an
assumption that I could not possibly be the first person to do this sort of
thing, mixed with the idea that <a href="http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp">“Ruby is an acceptable Lisp”</a> and
even a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day">“Talk Like a Pirate Day”</a>.</p>

<p>My goal in this project is to try to minimize the amount I need to implement
in my ‘assembly language’ (Ruby). There is an idea that Lisp needs to have
only seven primitive operations implemented in its assembly language and
everything else can be implemented in the Lisp itself. (Obviously this seven
primitives thing really only implements the symbol processing parts - things
like numbers, IO etc. really need to be implemented in the underlying
language). I have not entirely succeeded in this so far - I was more
interested in the beginning to implement the functionality; I think I can
refactor to more purity.</p>

<h2 id="1-current-state-of-the-project">1. Current state of the project</h2>

<p>I have implemented <code>ATOM</code>, <code>EQ</code>, <code>CAR</code>, <code>CDR</code>, <code>CONS</code>, <code>COND</code>, <code>QUOTE</code> and
<code>EVAL</code> all in Ruby. The features of Ruby I have used are subroutine
definition, conditionals, boolean true/false, equality and raising exceptions
(for undefined behavior).</p>

<p>The implementation of <code>EVAL</code> required some more helper functions due to their
recursive definitions, these too are written with Ruby as I had not yet found
a way to implement subroutine definition - especially not recursive subroutine
definition.</p>

<p><code>ATOM</code>s are symbols (<em>e.g.</em> <code>:foo</code>); <code>CONS</code> cells are arrays of length two
(<em>e.g.</em> <code>[:a, [:b, :NIL]</code>). Anything not an array is an <code>ATOM</code>. All public
methods of the <code>Yarlisp</code> module are named in ALL CAPS; these are the Lisp
primitives. Any helper methods are implemented as inner methods and are named
in lowercase. If it is not in ALL CAPS it is not a method available in my Lisp
language.</p>

<p>Currently the only sexp syntax available is <code>CONS</code> cells; the <em>list
shorthand</em> style of sexp is not yet available. This means I need to write
lists like <code>[:a, [:b, :NIL]]</code> instead of <code>[:a, :b]</code>. This has become very
annoying, very quickly.</p>

<p>One oddity of my implementation is wherever I call a Lisp primitive I do it in
an oddly Lisp looking way (odd to see in a Ruby file). For example, when the
<code>CAR</code> of the expression passed to <code>EVAL</code> is <code>:CDR</code> it returns: <code>(EVAL (CAR
args), env)</code>. While it makes the code look odd for Ruby - it brings out the
<em>Lispyness</em> of it. I will continue with this as an aesthetic in the code I
write in this project.</p>

<p>Because of my choice of Ruby as my ‘assembly language’ I have not needed to
implement memory allocation or garbage collection.</p>

<h2 id="2-thoughts">2. Thoughts</h2>

<p>I found this a fun little exercise and want to continue to do it. I think I
will also implement Lisp in other languages. It turned out not to be very
hard and was something that could be easily be broken up into pieces by the
different primitives and clauses in <code>EVAL</code>.</p>

<p>Now that I see all of <code>EVAL</code> implemented I think I can see a way to
reimplement more of the language in Lisp itself by using the <code>LABEL</code> and
<code>LAMBDA</code> Lisp functions. Also there are things like <code>:NIL</code> and true/false
which I could implement by having <code>EVAL</code> append bindings to the environment it
is passed. That way there will be default bindings for these things. Or
perhaps I’ll just leave that for the caller of <code>EVAL</code> to do.</p>

<p>I ran into an odd issue while finishing my implementation of <code>LABEL</code>. There
was a feeling of double evaluation on the arguments the method I was defining.
Since my goal at the time was to implement the spec as written I went along
with it. However I believe there is an superfluous call to <code>EVAL</code> in the
definition as given in the paper. I want to hunt that down and fix it.</p>

<p>What I am struck with overall is the cleanliness and sparseness of it. The
logic of simple, regular syntax, and the association list lead to no surprises
during implementing. Each step made sense; although <code>LABEL</code> and <code>LAMBDA</code> took
longer for me to understand - partly/mostly because the M-expr syntax used in
the paper, along with the formatting of the paper, made that section of the
specification harder to read. In reviewing my implementation I can see the
specification very clearly in it; the definition of Lisp is very clear in its
implementation.</p>

<p>I hope to continue working on this project - and others like it. I’ll continue
to write about my adventures with it.</p>

<h2 id="3-next-steps">3. Next steps</h2>

<p>The next phase of this project will include the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Adding the list style sexp shorthand - all these <code>CONS</code> cells are getting
hard to write out.</li>
  <li>Refactoring to higher purity of the language - implementing more of the
language in itself - less in Ruby</li>
  <li>Implementing a reader - which will need to be in Ruby. Although with the
more comfortable sexp syntax this may not be so necessary.</li>
  <li>I want to find a more Lisp way of handling the undefined cases - to remove
the raising of exceptions from Ruby code. This is an extension of the
purity issue above.</li>
</ol>

<p>The very next step for me to take is to implement a <em>real</em> example method in
my Lisp. Even though I do not have numbers I may implement a Fibonacci or
factorial method using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_numerals">Church Numerals</a>. At the very least I
will implment the <code>FF</code> method presented in the paper.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(This post is long overdue… sorry about that).</p>

<p>This chapter was not to long but had some points that were interesting to me.</p>

<p>Firstly the thought that refactoring before and after a change should be about
<em>clarifying</em> the code via its design. This should not be thought of as
<em>cleaning</em> or <em>gold plating</em>.</p>

<p>I found it interesting right when the Authors said that the job was not done
because the code was ‘feeling messy’ my gut was telling me that the code was
not too bad. This is something I’ve noticed. I think my gut is wrong and needs
some new calibration.</p>

<p>The last item I wanted to point out was the idea that you should defer
refactoring decisions until you can see/feel what the problems are. But to do
this you must know that you will take the time to refactor when you know that
refactoring is right. If you don’t have confidence - you will refactor
prematurely.</p>

<a href="http://cocktaildb.com/">cocktaildb</a> for cocktails which contain grapefruit and gin.  It suggested,
amongst others, the <a href="http://cocktaildb.com/recipe_detail?id=4758">Palm Beach Special</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 1/2 oz. gin</li>
  <li>3/4 oz. grapefruit juice</li>
  <li>1/2 oz. sweet vermouth</li>
  <li>shake well with ice, strain into cocktail glass.</li>
</ul>

<p>I enjoy the combination of gin and grapefruit in this drink but I have two
issues with it which I’d like to experiment with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I think it is too heavy on the gin - I think it overloads the grapefruit.</li>
  <li>I wonder if something like St. Germaine might be a good exchange for sweet
vermouth - obviously it would change the drink - but I think it might be
for the better.</li>
</ol>

<p>As an aside: cocktaildb is a great resource - I wish I could filter out drinks
for which I don’t have ingredients however.  That is why I am building
(slowly) my own cocktail recipe website <a href="http://defdrink.heroku.com"><code>(defdrink)</code></a>. (The primary
purpose of <code>(defdrink)</code> is to be a vehicle for me to learn <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="0-overview">0. Overview</h2>

<p>David Black (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/david_a_black">@david_a_black</a>) presented his his “The
Well-Grounded Nuby” presentation to the Boston Ruby Group
(<a href="http://www.twitter.com/bostonrb">@bostonrb</a>) meetup on 2012-07-10. I was unfortunately
unable to attend but I watched/listened in on their 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVQxmayBWOs">live streaming</a>.</p>

<p>He presented seven things about Ruby that every noobie should know. I guess I
am still closer to noobie than expert but I found that his points where very
good for ‘levels’ above noobie. His seven points were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything evaluates to an object</li>
  <li>Sending messages to objects</li>
  <li>Objects resolve messages to methods</li>
  <li>Classes and modules are objects</li>
  <li>There is always a “self”</li>
  <li>Variables contain references to objects</li>
  <li>True and false are objects</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought his talk could be summarized (<em>flippantly</em>?) into two points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ruby is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">objects the whole way down</a>.</li>
  <li>Ruby is <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html">Lisp</a>-y.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-objects-the-whole-way-down">1. Objects the Whole Way Down</h2>

<p>I had the thought that Ruby must be objects the whole way down; but I had not
tested it out, nor thought about it much. I just hadn’t needed to worry about
it in my small amount of Ruby work. But this presentation made me much more
aware of this. I need to experiment with this more and become more familiar
with this style. C#/Java (which I am more recently familiar with) just don’t
have this feel.</p>

<p>I do a lot of work day-to-day in <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> and some of the discussion
here sounds familiar. While I <em>knew</em> Groovy was like Ruby, I think it might be
more like Ruby than I had been thinking. I need to investigate.</p>

<h2 id="2-lisp-y">2. Lisp-y</h2>

<p>Perhaps it is because I’ve been reading <a href="http://letoverlambda.com/">Let over Lambda</a> but I
immediately started thinking lispy thoughts during a few points.</p>

<p>Specifically when he was saying that everything evaluates to an object and
discussed how <code>case</code> is just as <code>if...elseif...else</code> using <code>===</code> I wondered
how I might be able to write my own control flow. Does Ruby have
<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/macros-defining-your-own.html">macros</a>? I need to investigate.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-mixture-of-the-two-and-beyond">3. The Mixture of the Two (and beyond)</h2>

<p>His first point, “Everything evaluates to Object” and “<code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are
Objects” made me think lispy thoughts. On the first point it was simply “duh”
of course <em>everything</em> evaluates to <em>something</em>, and the second made me think
of the difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>/<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html">Common Lisp</a> with respect to <code>t</code>/<code>nil</code> or <code>true</code>/<code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Lisp has an object system - but it is built on top of an existing language
with the features of the language itself. There is something about this
presentation of Ruby that makes me start feeling that Ruby’s object system,
while a much more integral part of the language is still defined in that
language itself as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System">CLOS</a> is.</p>

<p>His point about “There is always a <code>self</code>” made me think about my recent
forays into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> at work. These have revolved around me
trying to understand what <code>this</code> was at different points in the code.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The talk was though-provoking in me; and thus, <em>IMNHO</em>, it was good. I have at
least two different things to investigate.</p>

<p>Overall his presentation made me realize there was plenty more in Ruby for me
to learn, and that there was plenty more in Ruby that was, to me,  <em>worth</em>
learning.</p>

</ul>

<p>Yes, I am a very slow rider. I ride a 1971 Schwinn 3-speed. Deal with it.</p>

<h2 id="places-seen-people-met">Places Seen, People Met</h2>
<p>I traveled through a variety of cities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boston</li>
  <li>Cambridge</li>
  <li>Arlington</li>
  <li>Bedford</li>
  <li>Concord</li>
  <li>Maynard</li>
  <li>Hudson</li>
  <li>Marlborough</li>
  <li>Southborough</li>
  <li>Hopkington</li>
  <li>Holliston</li>
  <li>Sherborn</li>
  <li>Natick</li>
  <li>Wellesley</li>
  <li>Weston</li>
  <li>Waltham</li>
  <li>Newton</li>
  <li>Watertown</li>
  <li>Maybe some more I didn’t even know I was in.</li>
</ul>

<p>I saw lovely tree-lined streets, I saw lovely tree-lined dirt-roads which
Google Maps says are bike trails, I saw empty suburban neighborhoods, I saw
strip-mall blight, I saw a wide variety.</p>

<p>I found out that while urban/suburban folk put out furniture with a ‘Free’
sign; rural folk put out yellow squash with a ‘Free’ sign.</p>

<p>I saw part of Hopkington twice; but the nice guy on the 2nd story porch
pointed me in the right direction. I told him “Hopefully you won’t see me
again” as I left, and he did not.</p>

<p>I stopped to tie my shoe and the homeowner working on his lawn asked to make
sure I had enough water - was going to get me ice-cold water if I wanted; then
we chatted about my bike and bikes he’s had.</p>

<p>I was only defeated by one hill: traveling south on Cedar St. to Hopkington
it appeared to me that the hill was about a 45 degree angle and maybe a half
mile long. After all the hills in Marlborough I decided to just walk up it.</p>

<p>I reached a personal-goal in the ride of riding across Interstate 495, I did
it twice; the second time was an overpass with no ramps was much nicer than
the first.</p>

<p>I managed to hit 30mph or come close a few times again; with a good road
surface that speed is much safer feeling. But one must be vigilant of any
possible bumps, and to be able to evade them takes a road clear of traffic.</p>

<h2 id="the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">The Good, The Bad and the Ugly</h2>

<p>It was good to go somewhere brand new to me, it was also good to have portions
of my ride be familiar; especially the end where after reaching Norumbega
Tower I knew exactly how to get home.</p>

<p>The bad was that I started the ride with a boring loop around the Charles and
then the very familiar ride out to Concord. I found that this stretch was the
most dis-spiriting; it was just a boring ride. The rest of my ride (except the
last leg home) was new roads I had never biked on (but I had driven a car on a
few it turns out). This was all exploration - that is what I need during such
a long ride.</p>

<p>The ugly? To put it delicately: my ass hurts.</p>

<h2 id="would-i-do-it-again">Would I do it again?</h2>

<p>Of course I would - I’m just that sort of stupid.</p>

<p>I need to find places to go and things to see. I also need to make sure the
ride is as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>Possible future rides (Century or not):</p>

<ul>
  <li>To Providence with a stop in Franklin (to visit family)</li>
  <li>To the source of the Charles River</li>
  <li>To Seebrook Power Plant</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this chapter we implement our first <em>real</em> acceptance test. It is an
end-to-end test of a real user feature.</p>

<p>I tend to run my tests repeatedly as I write them - so I hit a problem before
the Authors revealed it. It was the <em>surprise</em> problem of the connection
needing to be closed. I guess my running of tests often led me to find it
earlier than others might - so I’ll take that as a win. It was annoying to
hit it before the Author’s intended though - I thought I had a broken OpenFire
installation.</p>

<p>There were four things that stood out for me in this chapter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Their note about using the same value in test code and production code
(<em>e.g.</em> JOIN_MESSAGE_FORMAT) on p109.  This is a problem that I struggle
with in my testing. Sometimes I feel that it is cheating - or not really
testing anything. Other times I think it is the “Right Thing To Do(TM)”. I
am glad/disappointed that they have conclusive word on if it is good/bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They start implementation of the new feature by first refactoring the
existing code into one that will make the needed change easy. This is
something I’d like to internalize but I haven’t yet. I usually start by
implementing what I need (even if hard/ugly) and then refactoring until it
is nice and clean. But this often leads to 
<a href="http://bible.cc/matthew/13-42.htm">wailing and gnashing of teeth</a>. I also think, in retrospect that
I have missed the target of the really nice design, which no longer can
really see, but I <em>feel</em> is still out there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a phrase on p113 which I think is a good feel for how I usually
am thinking when I am implementing: “…our immediate concern is to get
message translation to work, the rest can wait.” It is this focusing on the
immediate problem and ‘faking-till-you-make-it’ that I do a lot. I like to
commit often - so I am always working hard to get small bits working and
committed instead of trying to do bigger chunks of work (although I can’t
say I am always successful in this).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On p116 the Authors say that the expectation is the most important line of
the test. However I find that it is hidden in the Java code needed to
create it. Perhaps it is because I always look at a test in the ‘arrange,
act, assert’ way; so I don’t expect to see an expectation in the ‘arrange’
section but in the ‘assert’ section (as it would be with Spock, Mockito, or
Moq for example). I wonder how else it could be made more visible?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally they point out the importance of writing the ‘first draft’ code and
then refactoring it after the tests are working. I don’t think I could
agree with this more strongly.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>On the whole a good chapter for the first real user-feature. I am still
annoyed with plain old Java code. Maybe I’ll need to start re-implementing
this in Ruby or at least Groovy sooner rather than later.</p>
