  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/4309417102/">Mother’s</a> Kartoffelsalat (Potato Salad) recipe is a German style
potato salad; not one with mayonnaise. This is the type I grew up with and I
think the other type is just <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>One day many years ago I asked my mother from the recipe and she gave it to
me. Trouble was - she didn’t have any measurements. It was all done by how
much seemed good. I present the recipe to you in the same way.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Potatoes. Boiled until they are cooked through - but not mushy. Cut up
potatoes if some are much bigger than others (so they cook evenly). Then
sliced into approx 1/4” slices. Peeling is optional.</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Vinegar</li>
  <li>Salt &amp; Pepper</li>
  <li>Onion - chopped</li>
  <li>Garlic - minced</li>
  <li>(optional) Bacon - cut into little pieces and cooked crisp.</li>
  <li>(optional) Cucumber - sliced very thin.</li>
</ul>

<p>I usually make it with 5lbs of potatoes (because I am bringing it to
Thanksgiving dinner for example). For that much potato 1-2 onions will be good
and something like a tablespoon of garlic (hard to have too much for me).</p>

<p>After slicing the potatoes while still hot and adding garlic and onion put in
oil and vinegar - make sure the potatoes are well coated. I like it to be a
bit sour so I make sure there is a bit more vinegar than oil.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>Can be served warm after cooking or cold, or reheated in a microwave, or fried
up in a pan (Papa did that one time when Mama was in the hospital and I was
still pretty young).</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Just a quick post about chapters 14 &amp; 15 of GOOS to get myself back into the
swing of things after a while…)</p>

<p>A few points hit me during these two chapters. Things which I <em>know</em> but which
perhaps are not entirely second nature to me yet (even after all these years)</p>

<ul>
  <li>In chapter 14 new features were added with little fuss - the relatively
clean design allowed for this.</li>
  <li>Chapter 15 showed doing refactorings bit by bit - it kept tests red for a
while but they got done. Just because it will take a while doesn’t mean not
    to do it.</li>
  <li>Chapter 15 also saw the developers thinking about how to continue down the
path they were one was going to be pretty annoying/boring. They took this
to mean that they were doing something wrong. They stopped and thought
about it and found a better design which allowed their needed changes to be
easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are three important things to internalize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good clean design leads to ease in implementing new features.</li>
  <li>A refactoring might be hard - but that is not a reason not to do it.</li>
  <li>If the change you need to do is hard / annoying - step back and figure out
why (see the first point).</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all things I <em>know</em>; but in the heat of the moment will tend to
forget. I need to really get them internalized; then I can <em>choose</em> to ignore
them at certain circumstances, but then I’ll do it more explicitly and know
the pros and cons.</p>

<p>Also as a side note there were some good points where the OO design skills
shone through. For example the addition of Java <code>enum</code> objects which quickly
became feature-ful objects which caused cleaner code elsewhere (<code>Column</code> and
<code>SniperState</code>)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The balancing act between delivering vs. code quality has been on my mind
lately. It seems to me that there are times when delivery trumps code quality.
But sacrificing code quality for delivery speed results in slower delivery of
future features.</p>

<p>(‘Code Quality’ here is defined as ‘good design’, ‘easy to change’, ‘easy to
understand’. This is not about quality as in free-of-bugs: that is <strong>not</strong> a
corner I will cut. I am also not suggesting writing <em>shit</em>.)</p>

<p>Are there any corners which are <em>safe</em> to cut? I have a feeling there is no
good answer; but is there a <em>right</em> answer?</p>

<p>I suppose as a bottom line the best to do is to keep the corner-cutting
explicit and visible to all people involved (that includes non-developers) so
that the eventual slowdown will not be a surprise.</p>

<p>Or is this just an invalid assumption on my part? Is there any time that
delivery can trump code quality? I know that everyone says that keeping code
quality high is the only way to go quickly
(<a href="http://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">@unclebob’s</a> pithy: “The only way to go
fast is to go well”). But that seems to be to be about the long term; I am
talking about short term speed gains.</p>

<p>This is something I’m going to continue to think about; I’d love to hear your
thoughts on this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just sat in on a talk by Cory Foy entitled “When Code Cries: Listening to What
Your Code is Saying”.</p>

<p>(Warning: there will be anthropomorphizing of source code in this post)</p>

<p>One thing I wanted to pull out of it is the idea of <em>listening</em> to your code.
Really listening. Like it was a person.</p>

<p>I don’t think it is just listening to code - but a conversation with code. The
programmer is talking about what they need, and the code is telling the
programmer what it needs. It is a give and take like any conversation. If one
side of the conversation tries to dominate, or ignores the other, the outcome
will not be successful. Like any conversation the failure may not be immediate
but later when misunderstandings between the parties of the conversation cause
problems.</p>

<p>Listening is not easy however. To really listen you have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decide to listen</li>
  <li>Listen for the whole message</li>
  <li>Let go of your personal agenda</li>
  <li>Be patient</li>
  <li>Be curious</li>
  <li>Test for understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>I personally have problems with listening patiently for the whole message.  I
tend to jump in, trying to add things, perhaps of my own agenda, saying things
starting with “So what you’re saying is…” instead of just waiting to find
out what is being said. With code this comes out when I too quickly jump to
refactorings or thinking that my coding task is done - because I’m not
listening to the code.</p>

<p>Having a conversation with code is not easy either. Mike Clement
<a href="https://twitter.com/mdclement">@mdclement</a> likened it to talking with his 18
month old child. They can’t talk - but they are trying to communicate. One
needs to be patient in order to get the message.</p>

<p>I am working on being a better listener, with people, but I can see that I
need to work on those skills for my code as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The following is the recipe for “Washabinaros Chili”, we found it on
<a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/washabinaros-chili">All Recipes</a>. It
serves 8.</p>

<p>The startling parts of the recipe which always attract people’s
attention when I describe it is the wasabi paste, the beer and the
coffee.</p>

<p>The recipe is not difficult but takes time. The prepping can take
20-30 minutes, and the total cooking time is 3 hours. However it is
worth the time.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>4 tbl vegetable oil, divide</li>
  <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
  <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
  <li>3/4 lb spicy Italian sausage, casing removed</li>
  <li>14.5 oz peeled/diced tomatoes with juice</li>
  <li>12 oz dark beer</li>
  <li>1 cup strong brewed coffee</li>
  <li>12 oz tomato paste</li>
  <li>14 oz beef broth</li>
  <li>1/4 cup chili powder</li>
  <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 tbl ground cumin</li>
  <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
  <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tblspn wasabi paste</li>
  <li>45 oz kidney beans</li>
  <li>2 Anaheim chili peppers, chopped</li>
  <li>1 Serrano chili pepper, chopped</li>
  <li>1 Habenero pepper, sliced</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Place 2 tblsp oil in large pot over medium heat</li>
  <li>Cook &amp; stir onions, garlic, beef &amp; sausage until meats are tender</li>
  <li>Pour in tomatoes, coffee, beer, tomato paste &amp; broth</li>
  <li>Season with chili powder, cumin, sugar, oregano, cayenne,
coriander, salt &amp; wasabi.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1/3 of the beans, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover &amp;
simmer.</li>
  <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the remaining oil.</li>
  <li>Cook the chilies in the oil until just tender, 5-10 min.</li>
  <li>Add peppers to pot and simmer 2 hours.</li>
  <li>Add remaining beans &amp; cook for additional 45 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>We use mostly Chipolte chili powder in this recipe, it really adds a
great taste and kick.</p>

<p>Also pick a good dark beer, a really ‘chewy’ stout. The last time I
made it I used
<a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18371/54019">Babayaga Stout by Pretty Things</a>. Of course enjoy the rest of the bottle while cooking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was prompted by <a href="http://proctorit.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/latex-in-wordpress/">Steven Proctor’s post</a> about using
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/"><script type="math/tex">\LaTeX</script></a> on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> to see if it could be done on
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">Octopress</a>. Of course it can!</p>

<p>A quick googling turned up a <a href="http://panchoat.org/blog/2012/06/03/latex-support-of-octopress/">Eason’s Blog</a> about doing just this.
His post links to <a href="http://chen.yanping.me/cn/blog/2012/03/10/octopress-with-latex/">another</a> which is in Chinese but the code
snippets are all you need. Note that Eason’s post points out that <code>config.yml</code>
needs to be updated… something left out of the other.</p>

<p>(Also a note: leave a blank line above the <code>$$</code> starting a multi-line
<script type="math/tex">\LaTeX</script> block for best results.)</p>

<p>And now for a test</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
    = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
      & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
            \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
                  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
                        \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
                            \end{array} \right)
        \left( \begin{array}{c}
              y_1 \\
                    \vdots \\
                          y_n
                              \end{array} \right)
        \end{align*} %]]></script>

<p>Looks pretty good.</p>

<p>I think Knuth would be pleased.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="0-background">0. Background</h2>

<p>About a year ago I read McCarthy’s paper <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf">“Recursive Functions of Symbolic
Expressions and Their Computation by Machine</a> and I thought about
implementing the Lisp described in it in Ruby (a language I was learning at
the time). The project languished for quite some time until just recently when
I went ahead and implemented the language specification laid out in that
paper.</p>

<p>The project is <a href="http://github.com/verdammelt/yarlisp">yarlisp</a>, it’s name means “Yet Another Ruby Lisp” given an
assumption that I could not possibly be the first person to do this sort of
thing, mixed with the idea that <a href="http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp">“Ruby is an acceptable Lisp”</a> and
even a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day">“Talk Like a Pirate Day”</a>.</p>

<p>My goal in this project is to try to minimize the amount I need to implement
in my ‘assembly language’ (Ruby). There is an idea that Lisp needs to have
only seven primitive operations implemented in its assembly language and
everything else can be implemented in the Lisp itself. (Obviously this seven
primitives thing really only implements the symbol processing parts - things
like numbers, IO etc. really need to be implemented in the underlying
language). I have not entirely succeeded in this so far - I was more
interested in the beginning to implement the functionality; I think I can
refactor to more purity.</p>

<h2 id="1-current-state-of-the-project">1. Current state of the project</h2>

<p>I have implemented <code>ATOM</code>, <code>EQ</code>, <code>CAR</code>, <code>CDR</code>, <code>CONS</code>, <code>COND</code>, <code>QUOTE</code> and
<code>EVAL</code> all in Ruby. The features of Ruby I have used are subroutine
definition, conditionals, boolean true/false, equality and raising exceptions
(for undefined behavior).</p>

<p>The implementation of <code>EVAL</code> required some more helper functions due to their
recursive definitions, these too are written with Ruby as I had not yet found
a way to implement subroutine definition - especially not recursive subroutine
definition.</p>

<p><code>ATOM</code>s are symbols (<em>e.g.</em> <code>:foo</code>); <code>CONS</code> cells are arrays of length two
(<em>e.g.</em> <code>[:a, [:b, :NIL]</code>). Anything not an array is an <code>ATOM</code>. All public
methods of the <code>Yarlisp</code> module are named in ALL CAPS; these are the Lisp
primitives. Any helper methods are implemented as inner methods and are named
in lowercase. If it is not in ALL CAPS it is not a method available in my Lisp
language.</p>

<p>Currently the only sexp syntax available is <code>CONS</code> cells; the <em>list
shorthand</em> style of sexp is not yet available. This means I need to write
lists like <code>[:a, [:b, :NIL]]</code> instead of <code>[:a, :b]</code>. This has become very
annoying, very quickly.</p>

<p>One oddity of my implementation is wherever I call a Lisp primitive I do it in
an oddly Lisp looking way (odd to see in a Ruby file). For example, when the
<code>CAR</code> of the expression passed to <code>EVAL</code> is <code>:CDR</code> it returns: <code>(EVAL (CAR
args), env)</code>. While it makes the code look odd for Ruby - it brings out the
<em>Lispyness</em> of it. I will continue with this as an aesthetic in the code I
write in this project.</p>

<p>Because of my choice of Ruby as my ‘assembly language’ I have not needed to
implement memory allocation or garbage collection.</p>

<h2 id="2-thoughts">2. Thoughts</h2>

<p>I found this a fun little exercise and want to continue to do it. I think I
will also implement Lisp in other languages. It turned out not to be very
hard and was something that could be easily be broken up into pieces by the
different primitives and clauses in <code>EVAL</code>.</p>

<p>Now that I see all of <code>EVAL</code> implemented I think I can see a way to
reimplement more of the language in Lisp itself by using the <code>LABEL</code> and
<code>LAMBDA</code> Lisp functions. Also there are things like <code>:NIL</code> and true/false
which I could implement by having <code>EVAL</code> append bindings to the environment it
is passed. That way there will be default bindings for these things. Or
perhaps I’ll just leave that for the caller of <code>EVAL</code> to do.</p>

<p>I ran into an odd issue while finishing my implementation of <code>LABEL</code>. There
was a feeling of double evaluation on the arguments the method I was defining.
Since my goal at the time was to implement the spec as written I went along
with it. However I believe there is an superfluous call to <code>EVAL</code> in the
definition as given in the paper. I want to hunt that down and fix it.</p>

<p>What I am struck with overall is the cleanliness and sparseness of it. The
logic of simple, regular syntax, and the association list lead to no surprises
during implementing. Each step made sense; although <code>LABEL</code> and <code>LAMBDA</code> took
longer for me to understand - partly/mostly because the M-expr syntax used in
the paper, along with the formatting of the paper, made that section of the
specification harder to read. In reviewing my implementation I can see the
specification very clearly in it; the definition of Lisp is very clear in its
implementation.</p>

<p>I hope to continue working on this project - and others like it. I’ll continue
to write about my adventures with it.</p>

<h2 id="3-next-steps">3. Next steps</h2>

<p>The next phase of this project will include the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Adding the list style sexp shorthand - all these <code>CONS</code> cells are getting
hard to write out.</li>
  <li>Refactoring to higher purity of the language - implementing more of the
language in itself - less in Ruby</li>
  <li>Implementing a reader - which will need to be in Ruby. Although with the
more comfortable sexp syntax this may not be so necessary.</li>
  <li>I want to find a more Lisp way of handling the undefined cases - to remove
the raising of exceptions from Ruby code. This is an extension of the
purity issue above.</li>
</ol>

<p>The very next step for me to take is to implement a <em>real</em> example method in
my Lisp. Even though I do not have numbers I may implement a Fibonacci or
factorial method using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_numerals">Church Numerals</a>. At the very least I
will implment the <code>FF</code> method presented in the paper.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(This post is long overdue… sorry about that).</p>

<p>This chapter was not to long but had some points that were interesting to me.</p>

<p>Firstly the thought that refactoring before and after a change should be about
<em>clarifying</em> the code via its design. This should not be thought of as
<em>cleaning</em> or <em>gold plating</em>.</p>

<p>I found it interesting right when the Authors said that the job was not done
because the code was ‘feeling messy’ my gut was telling me that the code was
not too bad. This is something I’ve noticed. I think my gut is wrong and needs
some new calibration.</p>

<p>The last item I wanted to point out was the idea that you should defer
refactoring decisions until you can see/feel what the problems are. But to do
this you must know that you will take the time to refactor when you know that
refactoring is right. If you don’t have confidence - you will refactor
prematurely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(It was noted to me that for a blog called ‘code and cocktails’ that I
don’t have many cocktail related posts - so here we go:)</p>

<p>I decided to try a new-to-me cocktail tonight and asked
<a href="http://cocktaildb.com/">cocktaildb</a> for cocktails which contain grapefruit and gin.  It suggested,
amongst others, the <a href="http://cocktaildb.com/recipe_detail?id=4758">Palm Beach Special</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 1/2 oz. gin</li>
  <li>3/4 oz. grapefruit juice</li>
  <li>1/2 oz. sweet vermouth</li>
  <li>shake well with ice, strain into cocktail glass.</li>
</ul>

<p>I enjoy the combination of gin and grapefruit in this drink but I have two
issues with it which I’d like to experiment with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I think it is too heavy on the gin - I think it overloads the grapefruit.</li>
  <li>I wonder if something like St. Germaine might be a good exchange for sweet
vermouth - obviously it would change the drink - but I think it might be
for the better.</li>
</ol>

<p>As an aside: cocktaildb is a great resource - I wish I could filter out drinks
for which I don’t have ingredients however.  That is why I am building
(slowly) my own cocktail recipe website <a href="http://defdrink.heroku.com"><code>(defdrink)</code></a>. (The primary
purpose of <code>(defdrink)</code> is to be a vehicle for me to learn <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="0-overview">0. Overview</h2>

<p>David Black (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/david_a_black">@david_a_black</a>) presented his his “The
Well-Grounded Nuby” presentation to the Boston Ruby Group
(<a href="http://www.twitter.com/bostonrb">@bostonrb</a>) meetup on 2012-07-10. I was unfortunately
unable to attend but I watched/listened in on their 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVQxmayBWOs">live streaming</a>.</p>

<p>He presented seven things about Ruby that every noobie should know. I guess I
am still closer to noobie than expert but I found that his points where very
good for ‘levels’ above noobie. His seven points were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything evaluates to an object</li>
  <li>Sending messages to objects</li>
  <li>Objects resolve messages to methods</li>
  <li>Classes and modules are objects</li>
  <li>There is always a “self”</li>
  <li>Variables contain references to objects</li>
  <li>True and false are objects</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought his talk could be summarized (<em>flippantly</em>?) into two points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ruby is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">objects the whole way down</a>.</li>
  <li>Ruby is <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html">Lisp</a>-y.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-objects-the-whole-way-down">1. Objects the Whole Way Down</h2>

<p>I had the thought that Ruby must be objects the whole way down; but I had not
tested it out, nor thought about it much. I just hadn’t needed to worry about
it in my small amount of Ruby work. But this presentation made me much more
aware of this. I need to experiment with this more and become more familiar
with this style. C#/Java (which I am more recently familiar with) just don’t
have this feel.</p>

<p>I do a lot of work day-to-day in <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> and some of the discussion
here sounds familiar. While I <em>knew</em> Groovy was like Ruby, I think it might be
more like Ruby than I had been thinking. I need to investigate.</p>

<h2 id="2-lisp-y">2. Lisp-y</h2>

<p>Perhaps it is because I’ve been reading <a href="http://letoverlambda.com/">Let over Lambda</a> but I
immediately started thinking lispy thoughts during a few points.</p>

<p>Specifically when he was saying that everything evaluates to an object and
discussed how <code>case</code> is just as <code>if...elseif...else</code> using <code>===</code> I wondered
how I might be able to write my own control flow. Does Ruby have
<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/macros-defining-your-own.html">macros</a>? I need to investigate.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-mixture-of-the-two-and-beyond">3. The Mixture of the Two (and beyond)</h2>

<p>His first point, “Everything evaluates to Object” and “<code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are
Objects” made me think lispy thoughts. On the first point it was simply “duh”
of course <em>everything</em> evaluates to <em>something</em>, and the second made me think
of the difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>/<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html">Common Lisp</a> with respect to <code>t</code>/<code>nil</code> or <code>true</code>/<code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Lisp has an object system - but it is built on top of an existing language
with the features of the language itself. There is something about this
presentation of Ruby that makes me start feeling that Ruby’s object system,
while a much more integral part of the language is still defined in that
language itself as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System">CLOS</a> is.</p>

<p>His point about “There is always a <code>self</code>” made me think about my recent
forays into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> at work. These have revolved around me
trying to understand what <code>this</code> was at different points in the code.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The talk was though-provoking in me; and thus, <em>IMNHO</em>, it was good. I have at
least two different things to investigate.</p>

<p>Overall his presentation made me realize there was plenty more in Ruby for me
to learn, and that there was plenty more in Ruby that was, to me,  <em>worth</em>
learning.</p>
