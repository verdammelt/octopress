  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I did something that was hard for me - something I haven’t done 
for a decade - I quit my job and accepted another one. It hasn’t been a 
decade because my current job was so great, as people who I have talked 
with over the last couple years know, but because I was scared.
Change is not easy for me - especially change which seems big to me - 
like changing my job. I pay my mortgage with that paycheck after all, 
thus I put a lot of importance upon it, probably too much.</p>

<p>But now change is happening. My new position may not be my “dream job”, 
I don’t even know what that might be frankly, but I think it has a good 
chance of being a better job. I’ll be working with some great people 
and I am sure I’ll learn a lot.</p>

<p>I’ll be put in the position where people are going to expect I’ll know a 
lot of things - and I’m simply not going to. I’m going to try to deal 
with those situations, when they arise, without running away screaming.</p>

<p>This change has been long overdue, but I am finally taking it.</p>

<p>Here’s to change.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My goal today was to ride a &ldquo;marathon&rdquo; &ndash; but in the end I extended
myself to 1/3 century.  Given that I had some errands to run I just made
that the &ldquo;reason&rdquo; for my trip.  I rode Gale. <img title="My lovely steed" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3506/3181434926_a4748e5e20_d.jpg" alt="Gale" />  Gale is a 39 year old, many-10s of pounds 3
speed. She&rsquo;s awesome. </p>

<p>First to get fitted for a tux &ndash; that was easy &ndash; but I realized that my
bike computer wasn&rsquo;t zeroed out so I did that when I got to the mall &ndash;
so 2.5-3 miles is actually missing from the rest of this story.</p>

<p>Then to the vet &ndash; over the hills of Brookline &ndash; to get cat food.  Ugh
the hills killed my knees because I took them too aggressively.  The 8lb
bag made the bike a bit wobbly &ndash; but made it home OK.</p>

<p>Then I rode off to the office to load up both panniers with books from
the office &ndash; no reason to leave the books there anymore.  Two panniers
FULL of compsci books made the bike VERY wiggly, had to be very
careful. A protest in the common right where I get into it diverted me
around the common on the street &ndash; which gave me the opportunity to see
and say Hi to a coworker, Heather Kanser.</p>

<p>Now, home again, I had to go back out to get mileage.  I decided to head
to Fresh Pond and take a ride around.  Lovely ride but the clouds were
gathering and then the &ldquo;lovely&rdquo; spring rain started.  Cold but
refreshing.  The path around the reservoir was annoying &ndash; LOTS of dog
walking &ndash; will need to check if bicycles are even allowed on the path &ndash;
maybe not.</p>

<p>It was on the way back that I got to my first goal, a marathon of
riding: <img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5180/5583426508_674c3241d6_m_d.jpg" alt="A marathon of
riding" />
and I decided to push on to 1/3 century &ndash; but where to go? Why the
Squirrel Brand Company building: <img title="The place where delicious candy was developed" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5299/5582840175_54992eeb9a_d.jpg" alt="Squirrel Brand
Company" />.  Heading towards home
I realized I needed to pad my ride a bit more &ndash; so I just took a LONG
way home &ndash; and riding through a COLD rain &ndash; and then finally: <img title="Made it!" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5025/5582840443_237d7fa63d_m_d.jpg" alt="33.33
miles" />.</p>

<p>Got home a very short ride later and my final ride was just a bit over
1/3 century <img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5259/5583427320_111cfc35c7_m_d.jpg" alt="Final
Tally" />.
Average speed just over 10mph. </p>

<p>Other than my knees bothering me a bit (due to the overly aggressive
early riding) I&rsquo;m feeling good.  Going to go get some Chinese food!</p>

<p>LoseIt helpfully tells me that my ride burned 1424 calories.  Means I
can eat plenty of it without worry.  Yum.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I kept wanting to say something to the effect: "But no... you gotta make <br />the code clean..." (and I probably pretty much DID say that several <br />times).[1] <p /> But the point Naresh[2] made is valid: Spending lots of time on making sure <br />your code is clean may not be the best/most profitable way to spend your <br />time. <p /> I think a good way to summarize his point is: "If you have a good team <br />(which you trust), with smart people and tight collaboration with <br />customers, then the code is not important and will take care if itself". <br />He suggests an approach of building apps/features quickly (and perhaps <br />not entirely cleanly) so that you can get feedback from customers <br />quickly to determine if it is worth spending more time on it. This <br />makes sense - and if the app/feature is worth it you go back and make it <br />better. But if it is not worth it - you don't bother; it would be a <br />waste of time/money. <p /> The important issue here is what 'good enough' means. Naresh says that <br />you make this app/feature 'good enough'. He gives two different <br />examples: 1) a feature that they put together quickly and the <br />customer didn't care about so nothing more was done and 2) an app which <br />is being slowly and carefully crafted because the initial release needs <br />to be awesome. Both are "good enough" but "good enough" is very <br />different in each case. <p /> If the team doesn't agree on what "good enough" means then you have <br />problem there. Which brings up that this idea that the code will take <br />care of itself seems to be predicated on the fact you have a great team <br />with high customer collaboration. <p /> So what if you don't? <p /> Naresh answered this by asking if pushing strict TDD or Clean Code (TM) <br />was a good way to fix that situation. I can't say it is[3]. Education <br />seems to be the best thing. <p /> Educating my coworkers is something I realize I need to do - but I am <br />not sure how to go about doing it. We don't pair program - so I can't <br />directly "show". I need to find a way to do this. <p /> ----- <p /> Footnotes:</p>
<p>[1] I feel that my disagreements with Naresh's points are not entirely <br />logical and are based around my current lack of trust (and opinion <br />mismatch) with my current team. I agree that his approach is pragmatic - <br />I worry that 'pragmatism' can be the cover for lots of dumb stuff which <br />cause pain in the end. Again this goes back to a trust in the team - I <br />do not currently have trust in my current team and that is coloring my <br />opinion of how I think his suggestions could work. For them to work in <br />my current situation would involve a large change, not only of myself, <br />but of the organization and its members - which I don't think is likely <br />to happen (but is this opinion too just because I do not trust the <br />team?). <p /> [2] @nashjain <p /> [3] Although as Zach[4] pointed out: in my current situation, doing TDD <br />and making the code Clean(TM) is sort of a defensive strategy for me. <p /> [4] @zdsbs</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>* Abstract: <p /> The SCNA 2010 conference was well organized, energizing and personally <br />useful. The short talk/long break format was a surprising success for <br />me; allowing attendance in many good talks while at the same time having <br />great discussion/chats with many people, both new to me and those I look <br />up to. Hopefully at least some of these connections will be lasting and <br />the energy gained from this conference will propel me forward to better <br />things. <p /> * In Summary: <p />  - Craft vs. Art vs. Commodity / Form vs. Function: Making 'beautiful' <br /> code is a great thing to do - but may not be what is needed. <br /> Targeting craft (like a well tailored suit, as opposed to a <br /> beautiful-but-impractical dress, or business casual from Sears) is <br /> probably the sweet spot. <p />  - Value to the Customer: Deliver what the customer needs - not what you <br /> think that need. If you think they need something else - TALK with <br /> them. Maybe in the end you can't do the work they need. <p />  - Always learning: Not a new point, but another good reminder. <p />  - Lots of connections made: Met lots of people, hopefully some of these <br /> connections will last. <p /> * In Specific: <p /> ** The format: <p /> Coming into the conference I was not sure if I was going to like the <br />shorter talks and longer break format, but on the whole, I thought it <br />turned out really well. During those breaks I met many, many passionate <br />and smart people. Also these longer breaks let me chat, or at least <br />thank, some people who I look up to in this community. In other <br />conferences the short time between talks reduces this opportunity, the <br />speaker gets mobbed by people at the end of a talk, so having the longer <br />time allows more people to catch the speakers and others in the rooms <br />and hallways. <p /> ** The talks: <p /> I found the quality and content of the talks to be generally very high <br />and the single-track format helped me ensure I didn't miss anything. A few points about the talks: <p />  - Uncle bob's point about multiple-cores/cpus making threading/state <br /> problems more prevalent is very important. If the trend does <br /> continue in computer manufacturing we will need to find better and <br /> more efficient ways to deal with the issues that arise. We need to <br /> find ways to help NOT have the problems in the first place. <br /> Functional programming seems like it might be a good direction to <br /> look. <p />  - Doug Bradbury's "personal statement" talk made a distinction I liked <br /> between craft and manufacturing (which links a bit with Fowler's talk <br /> later). Crafts are things made by hand, manufacturing is when things <br /> are made by machines. His talk really showed his passion for <br /> 'making' things, which comes out for him in programming. I also <br /> really liked his thought that the design of the program reflects the <br /> programmer.[1] <p />  - Michael Norton's talk about training software professional, making <br /> the analogy to medical doctors, made some good points to think <br /> further on. I don't have a clear opinion on the whole <br /> certification/licensing issue myself (but my gut feeling is I don't <br /> like the idea - but that is just a gut reaction without much <br /> thought). The part of the analogy I really liked was the idea of <br /> residency, collaborative learning and continuing education. <p />  - Ken Auer's started me thinking more about bringing value to the <br /> customer, it is a part of development that I partially ignore, or <br /> work on less. Later talks added to this. - From the apprenticeship panel I liked to hear from Collin that he <br /> felt that the programmer/musician analogy is often interpreted <br /> incorrectly, that it is not, to him, some sort of brain ability, but <br /> the focus on practice. I liked to hear this because unlike many of my <br /> colleagues I have NO musical ability and hearing the analogy is <br /> always a bit like hearing that I'll never be really good because I'm <br /> not musical. <p />  - Chad Fowler's talk gave me a useful spectrum between 'art' and <br /> 'commodity' with 'craft' in between. Form is most important for art <br /> &amp; craft while Function is most important for craft and commodity. <br /> Programmer's focus on making beautiful code, myself included, is <br /> tending to go to far into the art end as what the customer wants is <br /> something functional. His example of clothing, the beautiful dress <br /> which is not useful as clothing - but is art, the expensive but very <br /> well made/tailored suit is craft, and the business casual clothing <br /> from Sears is commodity. Also it was another mention of the need to <br /> listen to what the customer _needs_. If the customer needs commodity <br /> and you make art - you have not done the job right. Unless the <br /> customer truly wants something disposable then craft is best target. <p />  - Keavy McMinn's talk was another good "personal statement" talk. Like <br /> the musician-programmer analogy I've never liked the <br /> artist-programmer analogy since there too I don't have much, if any, <br /> 'artistic' ability. However her points were well taken, the factors <br /> which helped her as both artist and programmer are general enough to <br /> be taken as good ideas for anyone. <p />  - Enrique Comba-Riepenhausen's talk again hit the customer-value point. <br /> I found it interesting that three speakers, independently focused on <br /> this point, their talks overlapped and fit together well. There was <br /> some bemusement on each later speaker that the previous speaker(s) <br /> had "given my talk already" but each added their own factor. From <br /> Enrique I got reinforcement for the importance of _knowing_ the <br /> customer, even _feeling_ for the customer. This is an issue I am <br /> personally dealing with as I don't feel like I "get" my customer, <br /> they are not people I would "hang out with", they are not "my people" <br /> so to speak. I feel this affecting my work. <p />  - Corey Haines gave a good wrap-up talk and demanded that we stay <br /> positive, for both ourselves and the community. Negativity is <br /> another personal issue I deal with in all parts of my life, and in my <br /> work it has a particular effect on my work and my coworker's work. <br /> Also I am coming to the conclusion that I want to _help_ other <br /> developers in some way to write better code. Being negative will not <br /> help. Happiness is important.[2] <p /> ** Extracurricular activities: <p /> Outside of the conference itself, the Chicago Dine-around; the welcome <br />party; and the after party were even more great opportunities to talk <br />and connect with people. The organization of this and the execution of <br />the dine-around &amp; after-party left me very happy with the execution of <br />the conference as a whole.[3] <p /> A few things which came out of this that I am interested to see what <br />happens are: - Patrick Welsh mentioned that he was working (with Mike Hill) on a <br /> piece of specifically bad, but plausible code to be used as a sort of <br /> refactoring test. I want to see it, and use it measure of lack of <br /> knowledge/skill. <p />  - I gave restaurant advice in Boston/Cambridge to someone going there. <br /> Want to hear if they liked any of the places I recommended. <p />  - Determined I need to try to figure what specifically is wrong with <br /> work, so I can better determine if there is anything _I_ can do about <br /> it. ** The bottom line: <p /> The conference was tiring, so much to think about, so much socializing, <br />and so many really smart people making me feel dumb[4] just smashed me <br />down by the end. But - it is a good tired, the tired of a job well <br />done. <p /> ** Retrospective <p /> I need to do a better job of planning out learning/training. I need to <br />connect with, communicate with and learn from fellow travelers in the <br />Craftsmanship community (someday I will also then teach others what I <br />know). I need to find a new position where I can be happier, which will <br />help me do better work, which will help me be happier, etc, etc. I need <br />to be better about gathering contact info (or at least NAMES) of people <br />I talk with; there are a few people I remember really enjoying my talks <br />with, who I can't even recall a first name, let along a twitter/gmail <br />name. I need to challenge myself, I spend too much of my time just going <br />with the flow, that will not lead to my growth. <p /> Footnotes: [1] And this left me with an interesting frission between his obviously <br /> strong religious belief that leads him to feel that since he <br /> believes his god created him in that god's image that he too is a <br /> 'creator'. If the design reflects upon the designer, then I don't <br /> think that this god is a very good designer. The "design" I see <br /> around me is so full of rude hacks to get the job done that I don't <br /> think it is something to be really _proud_ of. The world needs some <br /> 'refactoring' in my opinion. Lots of redundancy, dead code, bugs <br /> etc. I hope to be a better designer than this god. <p /> [2] Oh and cats! <p /> [3] Also, selfishly and frugally, having my dinner/drinks mostly paid <br /> for me made me quite happy too. <p /> [4] When surrounded by all these passionate, brilliant people I feel so <br /> humbled, so small, so dumb. But, this is not something that can't <br /> be changed, it is after all good to be the worst amongst the great, <br /> there is so much opportunity to learn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The code retreat at the 8th Light offices was the first one I had ever <br />attended. Overall I thought it was great, and again was well organized <br />like the SCNA conference was. <p /> I came into the code retreat feeling a bit intimidated and left feeling <br />tired and a bit intimidated. Just like the conference the code retreat <br />was _tiring_, but still a good tired. And like the conference I was a <br />bit intimidated by all the passionate, smart people around me. I hope <br />to be half as good as these people are. <p /> I am very happy that I did get to pair with really smart people in <br />Clojure, Ruby, Javascript and C#. <p /> * High Points: <p /> ** I had never written a line of Javascript before and never even really <br /> read much either. It is very weird, but in a good way. I'm going to <br /> add it to my list in order to at least familiarize myself with it. I <br /> think knowing a bit of it will help me understand other languages <br /> better. My pair (Sean McMillan) did a very good job taking the time to explain the <br /> features and constructs of the language so that we can work <br /> together.<p /> ** The God class was an accident, as most gods are probably. Marty and <br /> I started the session saying we'd work on the 'always delegate' <br /> constraint. We quickly decided that Cells needed to delegate to <br /> someone above them... who could that be? God of course. But that <br /> flippant naming changed EVERYTHING. The whole session changed. All <br /> our naming changed. Near the end, we were writing some code and it <br /> wasn't feeling right, Corey pointed out the encapsulation problem in <br /> it. Cells were telling God what to do. Nothing can tell God what to <br /> do! The problem would have been visible without the naming but with <br /> the naming the code FELT wrong. <p /> ** During lunch we had a discussion that brought up the idea of the <br /> Cells themselves knowing about their neighbors, mixing this with <br /> genetic programming could lead to extra data on each cell which gets <br /> combined when the dead cell comes back to life rule is applied, as <br /> this could be seen as a reproductive step. Furthermore the extra <br /> data could be somehow relevant to the Game of Life itself, e.g. some <br /> cells might be more resistant to over/under-population than others, <br /> thus surviving longer. I found this a very interesting idea and may <br /> try to find time to play with it more. <p /> * Low Points: <p /> I felt I was a bad pair in a few cases as my thinking got rather cloudy <br />and unfocused at a few points in the afternoon (especially when pairing <br />in C# with @MaggieLongshore! sorry!) <p /> * In Retrospect: In retrospect I feel I could have gotten more out of it if I could have <br />snapped myself out of my mindset that I wanted to "get as far as I <br />could" earlier in the day. That would have let me play with other <br />constraints, like no numbers, totally functional etc. <p /> </p>

  <div class="entry-content">The characters, two from last time and two new ones went off the <br />moathouse (/FINALLY/). They hired Kobort & Turoko to come along. I <br />haven't decided just when/if those two will double cross the group, but <br />so far the time has not been right. <p /> They encountered the infamous Giant Frogs in front the moathouse. The <br />Giant Frogs which are well know to TPK plenty of groups did not roll too <br />well and there were no deaths. One halfling swallowed but managed to <br />get out, and couple people brought to near 0 HP. <p /> They quickly scampered back to town and I was kind and allowed the <br />Cleric from the player who could not make it to do some Cure Light <br />Wounds so they only lost a day in town. <p /> Again they went back, and again they took their sweet time doing <br />anything - but they found the Spider! or more like it found them and <br />started to gnaw on a halfling's head (same halfling as above). Finally <br />before getting killed itself it managed to sink is fangs into the Magic <br />User who succumbed to its poison. Poor magic user, never actually cast any spells in this game. <p /> So then back again to town, a smidge of loot dispersal and Players had <br />to go home early so we called it there. <p /> Fun was had. Dice were rolled. Monsters killed. It was successful.

  <div class="entry-content">In my normal gaming group the usual suspects of who runs the games <br />didn't have any big ideas and/or were busy with real life to put the <br />work into a big story. So I took a risk and said I'd run a AD&D 1e <br />game, some module I had, just to keep the dice rolling. <p /> Well, my first session was tonight, the two main people in our gaming <br />group showed up and with their 4 characters total they met most of the <br />important people in the quaint Village of Hommlet. The players seemed <br />to enjoy themselves, and I did as well. <p /> I had too much fun over-acting several NPCs and also kept them on their <br />toes a bit when the young hobbit thief wanted to do some <br />extra-curricular activities the minute he entered town. <p /> Next session they will be heading to the moat house and we'll see how <br />well they will survive that. It would be smart of them to take on some <br />help, hirelings or just let some of the NPCs join them. But who to <br />trust?! Zert the smooth talking fighter? Turuko & his big, dumb friend <br />Kobort? Or maybe Elmo the fall down drunk son of the Captain of the <br />Guard? <p /> I know who they should and should not pick, and am pleased to see that <br />they may be making some poor decisions... its more fun that way :).

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Background</h2>

<p>On August 3 Brian Marick tweeted [1]</p>

<p>   Agile is a melding of a craft ethic and super-responsiveness to
   change. How would some explicit Slow Programming <a href="http://bit.ly/ieB4n">http://bit.ly/ieB4n</a>
   fit in?</p>

<p>Then, on August 4,  Ron Jeffries responded: [2]</p>

<p>   @marick I wonder if TDD might be &ldquo;Slow Programming&rdquo;</p>

<p>I also responded quickly &ndash; but wanted to take the time now fill in some
more details to my response[3].</p>

<p>This response is based upon my personal understanding of the &lsquo;Slow
Movement&rsquo;[4] which may or may not be entirely in line with the actual
goals/aspirations of the &lsquo;Slow Movement&rsquo;.  Also at the time of this
writing I find that there is already a Wikipedia entry for &lsquo;Slow
Programming&rsquo;[5] but I disagree with the description of that as linked
from the Wikipedia article[6].</p>

<h2>What Slow Programming means (to me)</h2>

<p>To me the &ldquo;Slow *&rdquo; movement is about being deliberate, mind-full and
sustainable.  Thus slow programming would involve programming in a way
that is done with thought, and is sustainable over a long term.  It
would not involve quick &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; of code to meet arbitrary deadlines in
a way that cannot be kept up for weeks/months/years.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;Agile&rsquo; process(es)/practices to me lead us to this &ldquo;Slow
Programming&rdquo;.  Specifically the practices of TDD &amp; Sustainable Pace.</p>

<p>We all know that going &lsquo;fast&rsquo; does not mean necessarily going &lsquo;well&rsquo;.
As Kent Beck says: &ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t need to work; I can get it done much
faster&rdquo;.</p>

<p>TDD leads me to program very mind-fully.  Always thinking of the next
thing the piece of code must do or not do.  Before TDD I would just
write the code I <em>thought</em> was needed for the requirement.  But with TDD
I write the requirement as a test and then write the code to make the
test pass.  That leads me to be constantly thinking about the
requirement; constantly questioning the requirement.  I am always asking
the &ldquo;Customer&rdquo; what they meant, do they mean &ldquo;this&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rdquo;; and what
if &ldquo;something-else&rdquo; happens?  My code with TDD is not done more quickly
than before; but in the end I know exactly what it does; and it does not
more.  In the past my code might do things I had not intended (for
better or for worse).</p>

<p>Sustainable Pace keeps me from overextending myself for long periods of
time.  Of course when a important deadline looms I push; but through
long experience I know that pushing is a double edged sword: the stress
keeps me focused; but the speed reduces quality.</p>

<p>Programming needs to do be done very conscientiously and at a pace that
can be kept up in the long term.  One must always be 1) doing only that
which is needed, 2) questioning the customer what is needed to ensure #1
and 3) keeping up a good pace because burning out your resources are, in
my opinion, unprofessional, since it leads to worse code.</p>

<h2>In Reaction to the existing definition of Slow Programming</h2>

<p>When I began this blog post I was not aware of an existing &lsquo;definition&rsquo;
of Slow Programming[6].  That definition appears to be made in
opposition to Extreme Programming[7] and I think that is not the right
angle to take.  Given that we know that requirements will <em>always</em>
change (unless the &ldquo;Customer&rdquo; begins a &ldquo;Slow Business Requirement&rdquo;
Movement) the concept of having &ldquo;careful design process by a fairly
small number of people who know the business well&rdquo;[7] is not going to
work.  We must design only as much as possible to handle the given
requirements, meet them; then allow the &ldquo;Customer&rdquo; to play with them to
discover their next requirements. Perhaps this is the important part of
the &ldquo;Slow Programming&rdquo; concept: giving the &ldquo;Customer&rdquo; the time to
discover their own requirements &ndash; not rushing them to attempt to get all
their requirements before we start programming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>In Summary:</h1>

<p><em>Awesome!</em></p>

<h1>In Specific:</h1>

<h2>Presentation of Pairing Games</h2>

<p>The meeting started with a good presentation by Moss &amp; Laura from Cyrus
Innovation[1]. The presentation was their &ldquo;Pairing Games As Intentional
Practice&rdquo; talk which they will be giving at Agile2010[2].  The talk was
good and had interesting ideas about playing games with pairing like one
might play games with coding katas etc.  <em>e.g.</em> Do the pairing with some
specific restrictive rules such that lessons can be learned; activities
practiced etc.  They presented several games (Socrates, Silent
Programming) they have thought up along with the classic Ping Pong; and
guided us in the creation of our own game (One Minute Switching).</p>

<p>We put some of these games into practice when we went on to do a coding
kata.  I think it would be very beneficial to have the game playing in
the session; but their slot does not afford this.  I suggested that they
us an Open Jam[3] slot; they could announce it during their talk and
then guide the games during the Open Jam.  New games could be developed
as well.  I&rsquo;d love to hear about any new games that are developed.</p>

<h2>Coding Kata with Pairing Games</h2>

<p>After the presentation, and pizza we worked on the Tic-Tac-Toe kata.
We had five pairs and decided we&rsquo;d try out some of the pairing games.</p>

<h3>The One Minute Switching Game</h3>

<p>We started with the One Minute Switching we had designed in the
session.  The intention is to keep momentum going by setting a fast pace
of switching pairs every minute.  The pace was relentless and
unforgiving!  Every time we&rsquo;d start something we&rsquo;d switch.  I thought it
was a great game; it gave an urgency to all decisions and actions; but
definitely not something to do for too long.</p>

<p>The retrospective brought out similar feelings from the other people.</p>

<h3>The Socrates Game</h3>

<p>We switched and I got to pair with Abby [4].  I am so happy to get to
hang out with Abby again even if for a short time; she is so full of
energy and great ideas.  This probably helped making this paring session
really &lsquo;click&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Our game was the Socrates game which involves the Navigator asking
questions of the driver who must answer them after researching in the
code; or by changing the code to answer the question.  The group decided
that the new person to the pair would be the Driver as it would
facilitate them learning the &lsquo;new&rsquo; code.  It worked well; but all
pairing groups eventually move away from this game and went to a more
standard paring style after an initial use of the game.</p>

<p>Our retrospective on this game brought out the thoughts that perhaps
with so little code to learn/research the game was not well suited.</p>

<h3>The Silent Programming Game</h3>

<p>This was the &lsquo;hardest&rsquo; game.  There are two rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>No talking</li>
<li>Switch after three minutes if you haven&rsquo;t already switched.</li>
</ol>


<p>It was very hard for me to not want to just rip the keyboard away from
my paring partner every second.  I felt I monopolized the keyboard too
much in this case.  It did not help that my partner was not familiar
with C#/VS2010 which we were using on this machine.</p>

<p>The retrospective brought up the point that perhaps this game works best
when the knowledge level of the pair partners are roughly equal and they
both have a good understanding of what needs to get done in the next
roughly 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>My Quick Retrospective on the Code Katas</h3>

<p>I think for the future we should spend a few minutes to set up the
initial code needed so we have a failing first (generically named)
test.  Basically just something that says</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="directive">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> aTest() 
             { 
               <span class="keyword">assert</span>.Fail(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">test something here</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>); 
             }</pre></div>
</div>


<p>One or two &lsquo;iterations&rsquo; of the One Minute Switching game was spent just
doing this; as several of us were not entirely familiar with the IDE
etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand the One Minute Switching game was great for this; all
choices of the setup needed to be done quickly as the clock was ticking!</p>

<p>I also liked the quick retrospectives after each pair switch.  This
helped me learn a little from each paring session.</p>

<h1>In Conclusion</h1>

<p>This was a good session.  The Presentation was good and I want to hear
more about it.  If you are going to Agile2010 consider going to this
session.</p>

<p>This was especially great for me because I have limited/no opportunity
to pair program in my day job.  I find the practice engaging,
challenging, and even fun.  I&rsquo;m glad I got a chance to do some tonight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">I was going to join in on Boston's Bike to Work convoy at the end of May <br />and even was going to 'register' for it (I was on the <br /><a href="http://www.bostonbikes.org">www.bostonbikes.org</a> website finding out the routes etc) when the <br />registration brought up the 'waiver'. <p /> I thought the waiver was going to be a simple "if you get hurt its not <br />our fault - take responsibility - blah blah" sort of thing. After <br />reading it I decided I could not agree to the waiver; and that this <br />organization unfortunately did not want me to join on their bike rides. <p />  1. Section 2 of the waiver proclaims (in ALL CAPS) that: > "[I] UNDERSTAND that: (a) BICYCLING ACTIVITIES INVOLVE RISKS AND <br /> > DANGERS OF SERIOUS BODILY INJURY, INCLUDING PERMANENT DISABILITY, <br /> > PARALYSIS AND DEATH". <br /> Really?! Wow I better stop riding my bike - that thing is a death <br /> trap!. <p />  Shall we make everyone buying or renting a car sign the same waiver? <br /> What about people buying shoes or participating in walks (do those <br /> walks have such waivers? I haven't been in a charity walk for many <br /> years). <p />  Yes, activities one undertake in life may be risky. I would hope all <br /> adults know that. I feel that this is bordering on fear-mongering. <p />  2. Section 3 is all about helmet wearing. I do not personally wear a <br /> helmet. I don't care if you do. In my opinion it is up to each <br /> person to how they wish to manage the risks of injury from whatever <br /> activity they are undertaking. Walking on stairs, crossing streets, <br /> using showers or tubs have all proven to be very dangerous activities; <br /> helmet use there may be beneficial. Also clearly motor vehicle use is <br /> VERY dangerous (to both the occupants of those vehicles and those in <br /> their environment) so those persons should take strong precautions. <p />  This section states (again all caps) > "I FULLY ACCEPT AND ASSUME ALL RISKS AND ALL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR <br /> > ANY INJURY I incur as a result of my failure...to wear a helmet". <br /> So if i am wearing a helmet and smash my face on the pavement after <br /> failing to properly dodge a pothole/road debris I don't have to assume <br /> the responsibility? (The waiver does go on to close this loophole in <br /> another section). <p />  This section more importantly state that > "I fully understand that failure to wear a helmet while riding a <br /> > bicycle at any point during the participation in Boston Bikes is <br /> > strictly prohibited and will result in my expulsion from the event." <br /> Since I don't want to make a fuss, nor make anyone on the ride be <br /> forced to 'expulse' me I must not join the ride (sadly). <p /> It seems to me that through this waiver (which must be 'signed' to join <br />in these rides) that Boston Bikes wants to encourage helmet use more <br />than bicycling. I, myself, would like to encourage more (safe) bicycle riding, so for <br />now, I will lead by example. I ride my bike nearly everywhere. I <br />signal my turns and lane changes, I stop at red lights and stop signs, I <br />yield to pedestrians in crosswalks. I ride carefully, for my sake and <br />for the sake of the other road users around me. I hope that the other <br />road users take this example to heart and do the same.
