  <div class="entry-content"><p>(sorry I couldn’t help that title)</p>

<p>For a while I’ve been trying to learn what this <em>Monad</em> thing was. Smart
people were talking about them and making them sound important. Smart people I
knew and admired were making them sound like something I should know about.</p>

<p>So I’d try to learn what monads are and it all sounded something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Monad is Kleisi triple: an endofunctor, together with two natural
transformations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple right? I just felt dumb. I didn’t think I’d ever understand what they
were or why they were important.</p>

<p>That is until I watched two presentations. While I can’t say I <em>understand</em>
them yet, I feel like I’ve had an insight which might be useful so I’d like to
share them.</p>

<p>(Both presentations use Clojure - but don’t let that put you off if you don’t
know Clojure - the Clojure in the presentations is not very complex.)</p>

<h2 id="why-is-a-monad-like-a-writing-desk">Why is a Monad like a Writing Desk</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago I finally watched a presentation by Carin Meier called 
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Why-is-a-Monad-Like-a-Writing-Desk">Why is a Monad like a Writing Desk?</a> (presented at Clojure/West 2012). 
Given my big soft-spot for Alice in Wonderland references I was predisposed 
to watch this video.</p>

<p>Carin presents monads gently via a cute little story of Alice, a programmer,
who is trying to learn about monads but falls asleep and enters a Wonderland
like land of talking doors and Astronaut-hosted tea parties. Through the story
I learned a little bit about monads alongside Alice.</p>

<p>She covered the Identity, Maybe and State monads which I had seen before but
now better understood.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-monads">Introduction to Monads</h2>

<p>At the end of Carin’s presentation there was a link to another presentation by
Adam Smyczek called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObR3qi4Guys">Introduction to Monads</a> (presented at a Bay Area
Clojure User Group meeting in 2010).</p>

<p>In this presentation he shows a real case where he used several monads to
create a clean design for a testing DSL he was creating. It involved some live
coding which was good to see.</p>

<p>He also covered the same monads. Seeing them implemented again, helped
solidify my understanding of them.</p>

<h2 id="insight">Insight</h2>

<p>Watching these two presentation I came to a realization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Monads are not a <strong>thing</strong>, they are a pattern.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s it. That was the insight I needed. I realized that previously I was
always looking for some explanation of a <em>thing</em>, a language construct, and
object, a function. But that is not what a monad is (although it could be
built in to a language <em>etc.</em>).</p>

<p>Monads are a design pattern. They are a pattern
of flow control, a pattern of chaining functions on sequences of data.</p>

<p>I think my next insight will come about when I consciously implement code
using monads. I hope to create an opportunity for this.</p>

<p>I’d suggest to anyone who wants to learn something about monads but is finding
it tough to watch Carin’s presentation (sit back, relax, enjoy and learn) and
then follow that up with Adam’s presentation.  I watched them back to back one
evening and I think that really helped.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a note (perhaps for my future self).</p>

<p>I had considerable problems after upgrading Octopress and then trying
to deploy my blog to Heroku.</p>

<p>The problems stemmed from the update to the Gemfile. There were two problems:</p>

<p>Firstly: everything except for <code>sinatra</code> was put into the
<code>:development</code> group. Heroku runs <code>bundle --without=development</code> so
all those gems will be missing.</p>

<p>Secondly: due to an earlier problem with the <code>pygment</code> and python
environments I need to keep the following in my Gemfile</p>

<pre><code>gem 'pygments.rb', '= 0.2.3'
gem 'rubypython', '= 0.5.1'
</code></pre>

<p>After I fixed those two problems deploying to Heroku worked fine.</p>

<p>One bright side is that I now know how to use <code>heroku
releases:rollback</code> to shift back to a previous version. This let me
keep my blog up and running while I tried to figure out the problem.
(Not that anyone actually reads it…)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In May 1992 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from
<a href="http://www.wpi.edu/" title="My alma mater">WPI</a>. That means that I’ve been a ‘<em>professional</em>’ programmer for a little
bit over 20 years.  I have to say that while on the whole it has been good I
regret some things.</p>

<p>Firstly, I think I got a good education from WPI.  However I wish I had taken
it onto myself to get a <em>better</em> education.  I didn’t extend myself enough, I
didn’t really dig into things as much as I could have. I got good grades and
left it at that.  This is a regret of mine.</p>

<p>Nextly, upon graduating, I got some jobs and things went well. I fell into
thinking that I knew what I was doing.  I think I was, while cocksure, still a
bit better than the average programmer of the time with equal experience.  But
it was during this approximately 10-15 year period where I fell into a lull. I
thought I was good and I never did too much extra-curricular research. I did
have a small piece of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tnef/">free software</a> that I worked on during this time</p>
<ul>
  <li>but that didn’t really stretch my abilities. The work I was doing at work
was good - but again not stretching my abilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>During this time I only remember going to a single ‘conference’. That was when
the local <a href="http://www.acm.org">ACM</a> chapter in <a href="http://www.gbcacm.org/">Boston</a> brought in one of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four_(software)">Gang of Four</a> to talk about their book. I distinctly remember that during the
lunch I was so shy/awkward that I felt like never attending anything like this
again.</p>

<p>Sometime during the last 5-10 years I started to become dissatisfied with how
software projects were being run and how quality, my own and other developers
was being handled.  Sometime during this time period I was exposed to Agile
methodologies. Perhaps the time was just ‘right’, but for whatever reason
instead of just sitting around and accepting things I did a lot of research, I
started reading blogs, I started trying things out for myself, I even went to
conferences and made some good connections with people.</p>

<p>It was at this point I started to realized 1) how little I knew and 2) how
much I had forgotten.</p>

<p>This is where I am now. I am trying to turn myself around and learn more and
all the time.</p>

<p>I hope my next 20 years of programming (because I plan on coding (maybe not
always for pay) until I die) will not find myself falling into another rut…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick post to ensure I keep this moving along.</p>

<p>I have completed my review of Chapters 9-11 of GOOS.  These chapters cover the
starting of this example project – the Auction Sniper.  There seemed to be
mostly ordinary stuff here (perhaps it is ordinary to me now that I have
worked in something like this style for a while…).</p>

<p>After discussing what the scope of the project is and some of the 3rd party
protocols we’ll be dealing with we create a to do list of the initial
‘stories’.  This will be our backlog.</p>

<p>We then start an Iteration Zero to get the Walking Skeleton up and running.
I’ve seen Iteration Zeros which didn’t work - but I think the failure there
was not keeping them tightly timeboxed like any other iteration. The Author’s
recommendation is to keep them timeboxed - so I have no complaints there.</p>

<p>One thing mentioned in this chapter as the first end-to-end test is created is
“programming by wishful thinking”.  This is something that fits my style well
and I think I keep learning that if I don’t do it; things don’t end up as
nicely. Someday I’ll learn to trust the instinct and style.</p>

<p>Finally in the final chapter of this little section we get the Walking
Skeleton going. The code isn’t bad - there are some things I don’t find
aesthetically pleasing - but I don’t want to refactor too much - because if I
do it might be harder for me to follow along the future examples. Perhaps
after a bit more code is written I’ll refactor on a branch.</p>

<p>I think the major thing I’m learning is how happy I am not to be writing
straight Java all the time.  I write in Groovy mostly at work and Ruby and
Clojure at home. Straight Java is not horrible - but really there is so much
typing - it could all be done with less typing.</p>

<p>(Another reason to write this short post is to get rid of the mental block
that is keeping me from just jumping into the next chapters!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>I just bought a chainsaw - my problems are solved</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I created a modification to <a href="https://github.com/marick/lein-midje">lein-midje</a>
which allowed it to be a <code>lein new</code> template to help people get started with
Midje. I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/marick/lein-midje/pull/24">pull
request</a> and in doing so
realized that I really ought to have done my work on a branch.  <em>ugh</em>.</p>

<p>Knowing that Git is super-awesome(TM) I thought there must be some necromatic
incantation to take previous commit and put them on a branch. I was
surprised/horrified to find out how <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1628563/git-move-recent-commit-to-a-new-branch">easy it was</a>! (the first answer, at the time of this posting, is the important one).</p>

<p>For the record this is all you need to do:</p>

<pre><code>git branch &lt;newbranch&gt;
git reset --hard HEAD~2 # or however far back you want to go
git co &lt;new branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It seemed to easy to I tested it out. I created a new repository with a file
which was empty on the initial commit. I modified it two times committing each
time. Then did the above steps. Then on the master branch I committed a
different change.  Now <code>git log --all</code> looks like this (my personal formatting
stolen from
<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/pretty-git-logs">garybernhardt</a>):</p>

<pre><code>virgil:foo(abranch)&gt; git lg --all
* 0d4d369    (8 minutes)   &lt;Mark Simpson&gt;   (master) after branch
| * f0101f4  (9 minutes)   &lt;Mark Simpson&gt;   (HEAD, abranch) third co
| * d8160bf  (9 minutes)   &lt;Mark Simpson&gt;   second commit
|/  
* cceb15b    (10 minutes)  &lt;Mark Simpson&gt;   initial commit
</code></pre>

<p>Git is scary and cool at the same time. It is a serious chainsaw and you can
get stuff done, but you could also chop your leg clean off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(The second in a <a href="/blog/categories/goosreview">series</a> in which I reread
Growing Object Oriented Systems and try to digest it better. Overall this
section, Chapters 4-8, is filled with timely reminders to me about several
things about good design.)</p>

<h2 id="the-walking-skeleton">The Walking Skeleton</h2>

<p>This is one of the points in this book which seem like such small items but I
think have more importance than initial appears.  In fact I am surprised in my
rereading that the authors advocate the end-to-end tests to be done on
<em>deployed</em> systems - that is not something I’ve ever really tried and seems
very daunting.</p>

<p>The important things to remember here about the Walking Skeleton is that it is
<em>not</em> about writing real functionality, but meant to flush out issues both
technological and organizational. It will be definitely smaller than an MMF.
It might take a surprising amount of time to write it nonetheless. This is
because there will be a whole lot of learning happening. The same goes for the
first few features. (Boy is this a timely reminder for me right now…)</p>

<p>Unfortunately this slowness at the beginning of a project can seem like a bad
thing - but it is really not. The beginning feels a bit rocky - but then it
smooths out as deploy and integration issues have been resolved. In a ‘normal’
project the beginning might be smooth but the deploy and integration problems
will crop up and make the end rough.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-write-a-test">How to Write a Test</h2>

<p>The way they describe to write a test is something I try to do - but it bears
repeating (this is valid for tests at any level):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write the test you want to read (write helper code to make this possible).</li>
  <li>Watch it fail - keep working on it until it fails for the right reason
with a good error message).</li>
  <li>Now write the production code to make it pass.</li>
</ol>

<p>By taking the time to do this you will ensure that the goal and intent of the
part you are working on is clear. When done ensure it has a clear intention
revealing name - this is how you will understand the system later.</p>

<p>Start by writing an acceptance test for the feature. Write it in terms of the
domain and the user. An acceptance test gives feedback on the external API of
the system and upon major integration points both with external APIs and
internal components. Since the acceptance test is likely to be failing until
all parts of the code is written it will need to be separated from the main
build.</p>

<p>Once the acceptance test is well written then start moving down a level to the
objects that the acceptance test uses and unit test their functionality into
existence. This is the idea of testing from inputs to outputs.  Jumping to a
lower level object too soon will lead that object to have an interface which
does not reflect what it really needs to be. Only by building the objects
after building their callers can you know what is really needed.</p>

<p>The Authors have a bit of simple advice as to what to test first: they suggest
going for a simple successful path, and they make a good point why. Tests
provide feedback, if you focus your initial tests around error or edge cases
then your design feedback will be about that instead of the normal work of the
component you are writing.</p>

<p>One final important point the authors make on how to write tests is: “If an
area is hard to test don’t just ask <em>how can we test this?</em> but <em>why is it
hard to test?</em>. If something is hard to test it could be the tests are trying
to tell you something. This is one place I have trouble with - I seem to have
too much tolerance for pain while coding - a tolerance I need to cure myself
of.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-design-code-and-how-tests-affect-that">How to Design Code (and How Tests Affect That)</h2>

<p>Obviously writing tests before the code affects how the code is designed - the
pressures to keep each object isolated are very powerful. The book contains a
good set of design points which are not unique to the book and not new to me.
There were a few specific points I thought good to note.</p>

<p>When objects are composed together the interface for the composite object must
be less complex than the union of the interfaces of the composed objects. This
makes it a higher abstraction which hides some of the complexities. Higher
abstractions allow us to manage complexity.</p>

<p>Each object must be context independent <em>e.g.</em> everything it needs to do its
job needs to be passed into in via the constructor or the specific method in
question. Thus each object has external knowledge on a “need to know basis”.
This leads to the ability to recompose objects to get different behavior.</p>

<p>Create plenty of Value types. This combats Primitive Obsession and also
creates attractors for functionality.</p>

<p>Object peers (those objects which are communicated with directly) should be
mocked out in tests. This causes coupling and interface problems to be
evident.  Value types should not be mocked.  Neither should third party APIs
be mocked since the feedback provided cannot be used since the API cannot be
changed. Also mocking external APIs runs the danger of testing against
behavior you believe the API has, but may not actually have. Third party APIs
should be wrapped in a thin adapter layer which can be mocked in unit tests.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-types-come-from">Where do Types Come From?</h2>

<p>I rather like the Author’s descriptions of how types are ‘found’ when working
in the code. The three ways are valid for both Value and Object types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Breaking Out: When the code shows that an class is becoming too complex
that is a sign that it is doing too much.  Some of the functionality
could be split into helper types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Budding Off: When there is a new domain object a new type should be
created, even if is empty or contains only one piece of data.  The type
will act as an attractor for further data and behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bundling Up: When a group of classes are always used together they can be
bundled together.  Remember that composite objects should have a less
complex interface than their composed parts.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-final-note-about-mocking">A Final Note About Mocking</h2>

<p>I find that now that I can mock concrete classes in Java that I do not use
interfaces as heavily as I used to. The Authors specifically point out they
use interfaces quite a bit - again because they are concerned with
the communication between objects. I think this is one item I’ll keep an eye
on as work through the examples. I have used interfaces in this way before but
it seems lately I have not been doing so.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I agree with their design ideas. I already try to follow them. I am quite
excited to work through the example with them (something I did not do when I
read the book previously). I hope that by doing (and blogging about it) these
good ideas will sink in more; becoming more normal for me.</p>

<p>I also intend to blog more frequently on it instead of lumping large chunks
together like I did here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">GOOS</a> severals years ago but I have decided to reread it as I felt I
didn’t think it really got into my head the first time. Definitely I did
become more comfortable with mocking in tests - but I felt there was probably
more that I missed. So I am rereading it - and more importantly - taking a few
notes. It is those notes that I will be writing about, every chapter or two -
hopefully not a project that will end in a whimper.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>

<h3 id="a-learning-process">A learning process</h3>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="Software is a learning process.">
“Software is a learning process.” I am not sure why I didn’t catch this
last time. It is something that makes absolute sense to me now; and moreover I
don’t know a time when it would <em>not</em> have made sense to me over the last
decade. If software is a learning process, getting feedback on that learning
is of utmost importance.
</span></p>

<h3 id="nothing-to-lose">Nothing to lose</h3>

<p>The boxed-text about ‘nothing to lose but your bugs’ strikes me as ‘sales
pitch’. Having believed, then being bitten by this catch phrase I don’t buy
it. TDD will not help the developers write the right feature - just help
ensure that what they write is what they intended. It is not a silver bullet;
and I’d think that Pryce and Freeman had not intended that; so I hope that
I’ll see something that backs up this claim from them.</p>

<p>(However I <em>do</em> feel that implementing via TDD helps drive out cases that
might get missed until later exploratory testing. By finding them earlier in
the process we have a big win.)</p>

<p>After finishing the rest of the chapter I see their claim is that all the
levels of TDD practices: end-to-end; integration and unit; could reduce the
chance of writing the wrong code.</p>

<h3 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h3>

<p>Pryce and Freeman say that refactoring is a local change. This made me
immediately realize that easily fall into <em>large</em> refactorings. This is
something I want to keep an eye on. Not just for refactorings - but for any
work - I should work in small chunks.</p>

<h3 id="a-rose-by-any-other-name">A rose by any other name…</h3>

<p>It annoys me that there are so many terms for different levels of tests. I
personally use ‘Integration’ test for any test that integrates two or more
components (except for those sets of components which I consider a Unit - then
of course that would be a Unit test…). They keep talking about ‘Acceptance
Tests’ which to me are ‘User Tests’ - and given I just got back from some
training from Jim Shore I am currently at least moderately against automated
user tests. I do like End-to-End tests - that they call Acceptance test - but
need to keep them under control since they have the drawback of slowness and
brittleness.</p>

<p>I really like to have clear terms for things - terms that are understood
generally by people. I think it eases communication. That being said I see in
myself a lacking of clarity when I discuss topics. Reading this book is
bringing this up to me; perhaps it is something I need to work on for myself.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>

<h3 id="a-web-of-messages">A web of messages</h3>

<p>I think the important idea presented in this chapter is the idea the domain
concepts are not embodied by a particular classes in your code but by the
connections of those classes embodied by the messages that they pass each
other. This is an idea I remember having trouble with when I first read this
book and I am again having a little trouble making it concrete in my head.
Hopefully this second read will help solidify it.</p>

<h3 id="values--objects">Values &amp; Objects</h3>

<p>The authors present a nice terminology for two types of collections of data
and functionality found in code. Simply: <em>Values</em> are immutable without
distinct identity; <em>Objects</em> have changing state and have distinct identity.</p>

<p>Here again is a reminder to me to have a clear, consistent terminology to aid
in communication.</p>

<h3 id="tell-dont-ask">Tell don’t ask</h3>

<p>While I am familiar with the “Law of Demeter”, it is one of those things that
seems to quickly fall by the wayside as I code. Another thing to add to my
list of things to improve.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of good discussion about this on the internet - one
discussion and explanation of it I like is that from Avdi Grimm in his
blog post <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/07/05/demeter-its-not-just-a-good-idea-its-the-law/">Demeter: It’s not a good idea. It’s the law</a>. In it
he points to method chaining and points out:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;Look again at the definition of the Law: it never says anything about the
&gt;number of methods called, or the number of objects a method uses. It is
&gt;strictly concerned with the number of /types/ a method deals with.
</code></pre>

<p>So it is OK to chain a set of method calls together that all do different
things to collections of objects, or Strings for example; but not when there
are multiple different <em>types</em> of objects.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion-for-now">In Conclusion (for now)</h2>

<p>I am looking forward to continuing my rereading of this book. I think I will
gain from this review of important topics (Object Oriented Design and TDD). I
may not end up agreeing with it - but I hope to solidify my thoughts and
practices in this area through it.</p>

<p>Along the way I plan on continuing to take notes and then making blog posts
about it. I think through this process I will do an even better job of
understanding what I have read. I hope you all don’t mind too much.</p>

<h2 id="postscript---chapter-3">Postscript - Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Chapter 3 was a discussion about using JMock. Nothing really to note or
report.  I have no yet decided what language(s) I will be using while doing
the exercises.  I think I may just do it in Java with JMock so that I can
easily follow along with their examples. However another part of me wants to
do them in Ruby or Groovy or Clojure to help me compare and contrast.</p>

<p>In any case, any code written will of course be published to <a href="https://github.com/verdammelt">my
Github</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>I am returning home from the <a href="http://www.cyrusinnovation.com/index.php/art-of-agile-nyc">Art of Agile Boot Camp</a> presented by
<a href="http://www.jamesshore.com">James Shore</a> and <a href="http://www.futureworksconsulting.com">Diana Larsen</a> in New York City.</p>

<p>The training turned out to be review for me given that most of my coworkers
are <a href="http://www.cyrusinnovation.com">Cyrus Innovations</a> employees and they all attended this training
in October of 2011. They came back and implemented some of the ideas from the
training - so in a way I’ve been living this stuff since then. Even before
that we were a pretty well functioning agile team.</p>

<p>Even though it was a review I still thought it was very beneficial to me.
There are always opportunities to improve; and details/reasonings that had
been forgotten. Old ideas can become new again through re-iteration.</p>

<p>The training was split into two parts. The first two days covered Agile
Planning and the last three Agile Delivery. The latter was what I was most
interested in - but I think I may have gotten just as much out of the first
section.</p>

<h3 id="90-minute-iterations---crazy">90 Minute Iterations?! - Crazy!</h3>

<p>It was in the second half of the class that we got to “experience” Agile
Delivery for ourselves. In our groups we delivered working software four times
in four iterations; each iteration was 90 minutes long. It seemed crazy and a
few times it felt crazy - but we did deliver running software (a cheesy text
based ‘game’) in 90 minute iterations. During these 90 minutes we did
everything from release planning, to coding (TDD’d naturally), exploratory
testing, and releasing.</p>

<p>Crazy as it may seem - it is a brilliant exercise. By making us so focused we
needed to organize ourselves, help each other out and really work to remove
all roadblocks. Also it forced us to make, quickly, decisions about what was
going to be in and what was not. We couldn’t let ego get in the way and argue
too much about anything; we could always pivot and change our minds later.</p>

<h3 id="relearning-what-stories-are">Relearning what Stories are</h3>

<p>Even as a well functioning agile team I have to say that there were some
things related to stories that I now think I/We were doing wrong or not so
well.  Firstly, I was reminded that Stories are not requirements. Stories are
conversations about the requirements and they are negotiable. It is really
important that they are small and independent. A story on its own is not
likely to be a complete feature (MMF) - they ought to be much smaller than
that.</p>

<p>Another point about stories that Jim makes a point of is that they should not
be re-estimated. This seemed odd to me so I made a point to discuss it
further. It seemed to me that one should re-estimate a story if more
information is known. For example we may come to know that the implementation
needed for a story is harder than first thought, or easier (perhaps it is
becoming routine).</p>

<p>Jim’s point is that estimates are always wrong, but they should be consistent.
So if something was estimated as a ‘1’; then anything like it should also be a
‘1’; even if find out that it was easier/harder. The reason is because if we
change our estimations then our velocity becomes less meaningful. It is our
velocity that should be changing to reflect our capability for doing N 1-point
stories. That N will go up and down as 1 point stories are harder/easier.</p>

<h3 id="velocity-settling">Velocity: settling</h3>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="Decrease velocity easily. Increase velocity pessimistically"></span></p>

<p>Instead of simply doing <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YesterdaysWeather">Yesterday’s Weather</a>, Jim
suggests letting velocity ‘settle’. The way he put it was: 
Decrease velocity easily. Increase velocity pessimistically.<br />
The idea is that if you always use Yesterday’s Weather that your velocity may
tend to to be erratic, and more importantly that it prevents the team from
having consistent time for <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack</a>. While I can understand this
intellectually I find it hard to grok. Perhaps that is because of long
standing bad habits from previous work environments. It is something I’d like
to experiment with.</p>

<p>&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-delivering-value">Focus on Delivering Value</h3>

<p>Duh. I just needed to be reminded of this.</p>

<h3 id="fluencies">Fluencies</h3>

<p>Diana and Jim presented an idea of ‘Fluency’ in Agile Practices. Each level is
useful, none of them are ‘bad’.  They are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We build code.</li>
  <li>We create business value.</li>
  <li>We <em>deliver</em> business value.</li>
  <li>We <em>optimize</em> business value.</li>
  <li>We optimize <em>our organization’s</em> business value.</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea is that you are ‘fluent’ at a level, as with a language, when you can
easily work at that level, even under pressure. I think our current team, and
myself, is largely fluent at the level of delivering business value and
day-to-day we do some work at the level of optimizing that value.</p>

<h2 id="so-what">So What</h2>

<h3 id="the-first-thing-to-build">The First Thing to Build…</h3>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="The First thing to build is Trust"></span></p>

<p>Diana mentioned a good quote: The First thing to build is Trust. The
idea is that the first thing the team needs to get good at is delivering on
its commitments - consistently.</p>

<p>&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<h3 id="iteration-planning-is-a-design-activity">Iteration Planning is a design activity</h3>

<p>This is an interesting idea that I need to think more about. The idea is that
because Iteration Planning involves choices about what will be built; that it
affect design.</p>

<h3 id="people-over">People over…</h3>

<p>I always find interacting with people who are interested in or driven to
learning very energizing. A change in this time I realized what that now I was
the person who was answering questions of and encouraging people who were new
to Agile. I am starting to realize that I know this stuff and have something
to offer. It was also great to see a coworker doing the same, and doing a
better job than I did.</p>

<h2 id="now-what">Now What</h2>

<p>There are some things I want to try for myself and for my team.</p>

<h3 id="demos">Demos</h3>

<p>Right now on my current project we do not have Customer Demos. I said a few
times during the training that my project does not yet have a Customer, but
what it really doesn’t have is a User. I think we could start demoing it now
to whoever wanted to see it. At the least demoing to fellow team members may
help us be focused and see a bigger picture.</p>

<h3 id="story-sizing">Story sizing</h3>

<p>Currently our features are not quite <em>Minimum</em> Marketable Features. They tend
to be larger than that. Furthermore it seems our Product Manager (the Customer
Proxy) doesn’t care much about anything smaller than that. However that is
leaving us with only a story or two per iteration - which is not helping us
achieve a more stable velocity.</p>

<p>I need to do some brainstorming on how we can (or if we should) shrink our
features. Then figure out ways to split stories into smaller chunks so we can
have several per iteration (at least 4). The important thing here is to keep
business value in each story. While I do not think this will magically cause
my Product Manager to care about the smaller stories; but I hope it will help
engage them more if we can show business value progress with each one.</p>

<p>Related to this is the problem that it seems there may be some expectations
about when the current release will be shippable. My current projections are
much further out from those expectations. I need to use tools like Velocity,
Release Planning with Risk calculations (ala <a href="http://www.teamrabu.com/">Rabu</a> which I currently
use) to bring data to the table in my discussions with the Product and Project
Managers.</p>

<h3 id="root-cause-analysis">Root Cause Analysis</h3>

<p>Now that I’ve had this review I feel that I and my team have not been doing a
good job of doing root cause analysis on the issues in our process which we
discuss in our Retrospectives. Furthermore we are not doing a good job of root
cause analysis on any bugs that come up.</p>

<p>(On the topic of bugs I want to more seriously have the “Bugs don’t happen
here” attitude.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion the training was fantastic - even for someone who is not new to
Agile methodologies. I am bringing back some good ideas which may help me and
my team achieve even better fluency in our work. It also solidified for me
some existing ideas that I thought I/we already did pretty well.</p>
