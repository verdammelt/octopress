  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="0-overview">0. Overview</h2>

<p>David Black (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/david_a_black">@david_a_black</a>) presented his his “The
Well-Grounded Nuby” presentation to the Boston Ruby Group
(<a href="http://www.twitter.com/bostonrb">@bostonrb</a>) meetup on 2012-07-10. I was unfortunately
unable to attend but I watched/listened in on their 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVQxmayBWOs">live streaming</a>.</p>

<p>He presented seven things about Ruby that every noobie should know. I guess I
am still closer to noobie than expert but I found that his points where very
good for ‘levels’ above noobie. His seven points were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything evaluates to an object</li>
  <li>Sending messages to objects</li>
  <li>Objects resolve messages to methods</li>
  <li>Classes and modules are objects</li>
  <li>There is always a “self”</li>
  <li>Variables contain references to objects</li>
  <li>True and false are objects</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought his talk could be summarized (<em>flippantly</em>?) into two points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ruby is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">objects the whole way down</a>.</li>
  <li>Ruby is <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html">Lisp</a>-y.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-objects-the-whole-way-down">1. Objects the Whole Way Down</h2>

<p>I had the thought that Ruby must be objects the whole way down; but I had not
tested it out, nor thought about it much. I just hadn’t needed to worry about
it in my small amount of Ruby work. But this presentation made me much more
aware of this. I need to experiment with this more and become more familiar
with this style. C#/Java (which I am more recently familiar with) just don’t
have this feel.</p>

<p>I do a lot of work day-to-day in <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> and some of the discussion
here sounds familiar. While I <em>knew</em> Groovy was like Ruby, I think it might be
more like Ruby than I had been thinking. I need to investigate.</p>

<h2 id="2-lisp-y">2. Lisp-y</h2>

<p>Perhaps it is because I’ve been reading <a href="http://letoverlambda.com/">Let over Lambda</a> but I
immediately started thinking lispy thoughts during a few points.</p>

<p>Specifically when he was saying that everything evaluates to an object and
discussed how <code>case</code> is just as <code>if...elseif...else</code> using <code>===</code> I wondered
how I might be able to write my own control flow. Does Ruby have
<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/macros-defining-your-own.html">macros</a>? I need to investigate.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-mixture-of-the-two-and-beyond">3. The Mixture of the Two (and beyond)</h2>

<p>His first point, “Everything evaluates to Object” and “<code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are
Objects” made me think lispy thoughts. On the first point it was simply “duh”
of course <em>everything</em> evaluates to <em>something</em>, and the second made me think
of the difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>/<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html">Common Lisp</a> with respect to <code>t</code>/<code>nil</code> or <code>true</code>/<code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Lisp has an object system - but it is built on top of an existing language
with the features of the language itself. There is something about this
presentation of Ruby that makes me start feeling that Ruby’s object system,
while a much more integral part of the language is still defined in that
language itself as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System">CLOS</a> is.</p>

<p>His point about “There is always a <code>self</code>” made me think about my recent
forays into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> at work. These have revolved around me
trying to understand what <code>this</code> was at different points in the code.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The talk was though-provoking in me; and thus, <em>IMNHO</em>, it was good. I have at
least two different things to investigate.</p>

<p>Overall his presentation made me realize there was plenty more in Ruby for me
to learn, and that there was plenty more in Ruby that was, to me,  <em>worth</em>
learning.</p>

<p>Yes, I am a very slow rider. I ride a 1971 Schwinn 3-speed. Deal with it.</p>

<h2 id="places-seen-people-met">Places Seen, People Met</h2>
<p>I traveled through a variety of cities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boston</li>
  <li>Cambridge</li>
  <li>Arlington</li>
  <li>Bedford</li>
  <li>Concord</li>
  <li>Maynard</li>
  <li>Hudson</li>
  <li>Marlborough</li>
  <li>Southborough</li>
  <li>Hopkington</li>
  <li>Holliston</li>
  <li>Sherborn</li>
  <li>Natick</li>
  <li>Wellesley</li>
  <li>Weston</li>
  <li>Waltham</li>
  <li>Newton</li>
  <li>Watertown</li>
  <li>Maybe some more I didn’t even know I was in.</li>
</ul>

<p>I saw lovely tree-lined streets, I saw lovely tree-lined dirt-roads which
Google Maps says are bike trails, I saw empty suburban neighborhoods, I saw
strip-mall blight, I saw a wide variety.</p>

<p>I found out that while urban/suburban folk put out furniture with a ‘Free’
sign; rural folk put out yellow squash with a ‘Free’ sign.</p>

<p>I saw part of Hopkington twice; but the nice guy on the 2nd story porch
pointed me in the right direction. I told him “Hopefully you won’t see me
again” as I left, and he did not.</p>

<p>I stopped to tie my shoe and the homeowner working on his lawn asked to make
sure I had enough water - was going to get me ice-cold water if I wanted; then
we chatted about my bike and bikes he’s had.</p>

<p>I was only defeated by one hill: traveling south on Cedar St. to Hopkington
it appeared to me that the hill was about a 45 degree angle and maybe a half
mile long. After all the hills in Marlborough I decided to just walk up it.</p>

<p>I reached a personal-goal in the ride of riding across Interstate 495, I did
it twice; the second time was an overpass with no ramps was much nicer than
the first.</p>

<p>I managed to hit 30mph or come close a few times again; with a good road
surface that speed is much safer feeling. But one must be vigilant of any
possible bumps, and to be able to evade them takes a road clear of traffic.</p>

<h2 id="the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">The Good, The Bad and the Ugly</h2>

<p>It was good to go somewhere brand new to me, it was also good to have portions
of my ride be familiar; especially the end where after reaching Norumbega
Tower I knew exactly how to get home.</p>

<p>The bad was that I started the ride with a boring loop around the Charles and
then the very familiar ride out to Concord. I found that this stretch was the
most dis-spiriting; it was just a boring ride. The rest of my ride (except the
last leg home) was new roads I had never biked on (but I had driven a car on a
few it turns out). This was all exploration - that is what I need during such
a long ride.</p>

<p>The ugly? To put it delicately: my ass hurts.</p>

<h2 id="would-i-do-it-again">Would I do it again?</h2>

<p>Of course I would - I’m just that sort of stupid.</p>

<p>I need to find places to go and things to see. I also need to make sure the
ride is as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>Possible future rides (Century or not):</p>

<ul>
  <li>To Providence with a stop in Franklin (to visit family)</li>
  <li>To the source of the Charles River</li>
  <li>To Seebrook Power Plant</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this chapter we implement our first <em>real</em> acceptance test. It is an
end-to-end test of a real user feature.</p>

<p>I tend to run my tests repeatedly as I write them - so I hit a problem before
the Authors revealed it. It was the <em>surprise</em> problem of the connection
needing to be closed. I guess my running of tests often led me to find it
earlier than others might - so I’ll take that as a win. It was annoying to
hit it before the Author’s intended though - I thought I had a broken OpenFire
installation.</p>

<p>There were four things that stood out for me in this chapter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Their note about using the same value in test code and production code
(<em>e.g.</em> JOIN_MESSAGE_FORMAT) on p109.  This is a problem that I struggle
with in my testing. Sometimes I feel that it is cheating - or not really
testing anything. Other times I think it is the “Right Thing To Do(TM)”. I
am glad/disappointed that they have conclusive word on if it is good/bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They start implementation of the new feature by first refactoring the
existing code into one that will make the needed change easy. This is
something I’d like to internalize but I haven’t yet. I usually start by
implementing what I need (even if hard/ugly) and then refactoring until it
is nice and clean. But this often leads to 
<a href="http://bible.cc/matthew/13-42.htm">wailing and gnashing of teeth</a>. I also think, in retrospect that
I have missed the target of the really nice design, which no longer can
really see, but I <em>feel</em> is still out there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a phrase on p113 which I think is a good feel for how I usually
am thinking when I am implementing: “…our immediate concern is to get
message translation to work, the rest can wait.” It is this focusing on the
immediate problem and ‘faking-till-you-make-it’ that I do a lot. I like to
commit often - so I am always working hard to get small bits working and
committed instead of trying to do bigger chunks of work (although I can’t
say I am always successful in this).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On p116 the Authors say that the expectation is the most important line of
the test. However I find that it is hidden in the Java code needed to
create it. Perhaps it is because I always look at a test in the ‘arrange,
act, assert’ way; so I don’t expect to see an expectation in the ‘arrange’
section but in the ‘assert’ section (as it would be with Spock, Mockito, or
Moq for example). I wonder how else it could be made more visible?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally they point out the importance of writing the ‘first draft’ code and
then refactoring it after the tests are working. I don’t think I could
agree with this more strongly.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>On the whole a good chapter for the first real user-feature. I am still
annoyed with plain old Java code. Maybe I’ll need to start re-implementing
this in Ruby or at least Groovy sooner rather than later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(sorry I couldn’t help that title)</p>

<p>For a while I’ve been trying to learn what this <em>Monad</em> thing was. Smart
people were talking about them and making them sound important. Smart people I
knew and admired were making them sound like something I should know about.</p>

<p>So I’d try to learn what monads are and it all sounded something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Monad is Kleisi triple: an endofunctor, together with two natural
transformations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple right? I just felt dumb. I didn’t think I’d ever understand what they
were or why they were important.</p>

<p>That is until I watched two presentations. While I can’t say I <em>understand</em>
them yet, I feel like I’ve had an insight which might be useful so I’d like to
share them.</p>

<p>(Both presentations use Clojure - but don’t let that put you off if you don’t
know Clojure - the Clojure in the presentations is not very complex.)</p>

<h2 id="why-is-a-monad-like-a-writing-desk">Why is a Monad like a Writing Desk</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago I finally watched a presentation by Carin Meier called 
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Why-is-a-Monad-Like-a-Writing-Desk">Why is a Monad like a Writing Desk?</a> (presented at Clojure/West 2012). 
Given my big soft-spot for Alice in Wonderland references I was predisposed 
to watch this video.</p>

<p>Carin presents monads gently via a cute little story of Alice, a programmer,
who is trying to learn about monads but falls asleep and enters a Wonderland
like land of talking doors and Astronaut-hosted tea parties. Through the story
I learned a little bit about monads alongside Alice.</p>

<p>She covered the Identity, Maybe and State monads which I had seen before but
now better understood.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-monads">Introduction to Monads</h2>

<p>At the end of Carin’s presentation there was a link to another presentation by
Adam Smyczek called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObR3qi4Guys">Introduction to Monads</a> (presented at a Bay Area
Clojure User Group meeting in 2010).</p>

<p>In this presentation he shows a real case where he used several monads to
create a clean design for a testing DSL he was creating. It involved some live
coding which was good to see.</p>

<p>He also covered the same monads. Seeing them implemented again, helped
solidify my understanding of them.</p>

<h2 id="insight">Insight</h2>

<p>Watching these two presentation I came to a realization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Monads are not a <strong>thing</strong>, they are a pattern.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s it. That was the insight I needed. I realized that previously I was
always looking for some explanation of a <em>thing</em>, a language construct, and
object, a function. But that is not what a monad is (although it could be
built in to a language <em>etc.</em>).</p>

<p>Monads are a design pattern. They are a pattern
of flow control, a pattern of chaining functions on sequences of data.</p>

<p>I think my next insight will come about when I consciously implement code
using monads. I hope to create an opportunity for this.</p>

<p>I’d suggest to anyone who wants to learn something about monads but is finding
it tough to watch Carin’s presentation (sit back, relax, enjoy and learn) and
then follow that up with Adam’s presentation.  I watched them back to back one
evening and I think that really helped.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a note (perhaps for my future self).</p>

<p>I had considerable problems after upgrading Octopress and then trying
to deploy my blog to Heroku.</p>

<p>The problems stemmed from the update to the Gemfile. There were two problems:</p>

<p>Firstly: everything except for <code>sinatra</code> was put into the
<code>:development</code> group. Heroku runs <code>bundle --without=development</code> so
all those gems will be missing.</p>

<p>Secondly: due to an earlier problem with the <code>pygment</code> and python
environments I need to keep the following in my Gemfile</p>

<pre><code>gem 'pygments.rb', '= 0.2.3'
gem 'rubypython', '= 0.5.1'
</code></pre>

<p>After I fixed those two problems deploying to Heroku worked fine.</p>

<p>One bright side is that I now know how to use <code>heroku
releases:rollback</code> to shift back to a previous version. This let me
keep my blog up and running while I tried to figure out the problem.
(Not that anyone actually reads it…)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In May 1992 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from
<a href="http://www.wpi.edu/" title="My alma mater">WPI</a>. That means that I’ve been a ‘<em>professional</em>’ programmer for a little
bit over 20 years.  I have to say that while on the whole it has been good I
regret some things.</p>

<p>Firstly, I think I got a good education from WPI.  However I wish I had taken
it onto myself to get a <em>better</em> education.  I didn’t extend myself enough, I
didn’t really dig into things as much as I could have. I got good grades and
left it at that.  This is a regret of mine.</p>

<p>Nextly, upon graduating, I got some jobs and things went well. I fell into
thinking that I knew what I was doing.  I think I was, while cocksure, still a
bit better than the average programmer of the time with equal experience.  But
it was during this approximately 10-15 year period where I fell into a lull. I
thought I was good and I never did too much extra-curricular research. I did
have a small piece of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tnef/">free software</a> that I worked on during this time</p>
<ul>
  <li>but that didn’t really stretch my abilities. The work I was doing at work
was good - but again not stretching my abilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>During this time I only remember going to a single ‘conference’. That was when
the local <a href="http://www.acm.org">ACM</a> chapter in <a href="http://www.gbcacm.org/">Boston</a> brought in one of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four_(software)">Gang of Four</a> to talk about their book. I distinctly remember that during the
lunch I was so shy/awkward that I felt like never attending anything like this
again.</p>

<p>Sometime during the last 5-10 years I started to become dissatisfied with how
software projects were being run and how quality, my own and other developers
was being handled.  Sometime during this time period I was exposed to Agile
methodologies. Perhaps the time was just ‘right’, but for whatever reason
instead of just sitting around and accepting things I did a lot of research, I
started reading blogs, I started trying things out for myself, I even went to
conferences and made some good connections with people.</p>

<p>It was at this point I started to realized 1) how little I knew and 2) how
much I had forgotten.</p>

<p>This is where I am now. I am trying to turn myself around and learn more and
all the time.</p>

<p>I hope my next 20 years of programming (because I plan on coding (maybe not
always for pay) until I die) will not find myself falling into another rut…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick post to ensure I keep this moving along.</p>

<p>I have completed my review of Chapters 9-11 of GOOS.  These chapters cover the
starting of this example project – the Auction Sniper.  There seemed to be
mostly ordinary stuff here (perhaps it is ordinary to me now that I have
worked in something like this style for a while…).</p>

<p>After discussing what the scope of the project is and some of the 3rd party
protocols we’ll be dealing with we create a to do list of the initial
‘stories’.  This will be our backlog.</p>

<p>We then start an Iteration Zero to get the Walking Skeleton up and running.
I’ve seen Iteration Zeros which didn’t work - but I think the failure there
was not keeping them tightly timeboxed like any other iteration. The Author’s
recommendation is to keep them timeboxed - so I have no complaints there.</p>

<p>One thing mentioned in this chapter as the first end-to-end test is created is
“programming by wishful thinking”.  This is something that fits my style well
and I think I keep learning that if I don’t do it; things don’t end up as
nicely. Someday I’ll learn to trust the instinct and style.</p>

<p>Finally in the final chapter of this little section we get the Walking
Skeleton going. The code isn’t bad - there are some things I don’t find
aesthetically pleasing - but I don’t want to refactor too much - because if I
do it might be harder for me to follow along the future examples. Perhaps
after a bit more code is written I’ll refactor on a branch.</p>

<p>I think the major thing I’m learning is how happy I am not to be writing
straight Java all the time.  I write in Groovy mostly at work and Ruby and
Clojure at home. Straight Java is not horrible - but really there is so much
typing - it could all be done with less typing.</p>

<p>(Another reason to write this short post is to get rid of the mental block
that is keeping me from just jumping into the next chapters!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>I just bought a chainsaw - my problems are solved</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I created a modification to <a href="https://github.com/marick/lein-midje">lein-midje</a>
which allowed it to be a <code>lein new</code> template to help people get started with
Midje. I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/marick/lein-midje/pull/24">pull
request</a> and in doing so
realized that I really ought to have done my work on a branch.  <em>ugh</em>.</p>

<p>Knowing that Git is super-awesome(TM) I thought there must be some necromatic
incantation to take previous commit and put them on a branch. I was
surprised/horrified to find out how <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1628563/git-move-recent-commit-to-a-new-branch">easy it was</a>! (the first answer, at the time of this posting, is the important one).</p>

<p>For the record this is all you need to do:</p>

<pre><code>git branch &lt;newbranch&gt;
git reset --hard HEAD~2 # or however far back you want to go
git co &lt;new branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It seemed to easy to I tested it out. I created a new repository with a file
which was empty on the initial commit. I modified it two times committing each
time. Then did the above steps. Then on the master branch I committed a
different change.  Now <code>git log --all</code> looks like this (my personal formatting
stolen from
<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/pretty-git-logs">garybernhardt</a>):</p>

<pre><code>virgil:foo(abranch)&gt; git lg --all
* 0d4d369    (8 minutes)   &lt;Mark Simpson&gt;   (master) after branch
| * f0101f4  (9 minutes)   &lt;Mark Simpson&gt;   (HEAD, abranch) third co
| * d8160bf  (9 minutes)   &lt;Mark Simpson&gt;   second commit
|/  
* cceb15b    (10 minutes)  &lt;Mark Simpson&gt;   initial commit
</code></pre>

<p>Git is scary and cool at the same time. It is a serious chainsaw and you can
get stuff done, but you could also chop your leg clean off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(The second in a <a href="/blog/categories/goosreview">series</a> in which I reread
Growing Object Oriented Systems and try to digest it better. Overall this
section, Chapters 4-8, is filled with timely reminders to me about several
things about good design.)</p>

<h2 id="the-walking-skeleton">The Walking Skeleton</h2>

<p>This is one of the points in this book which seem like such small items but I
think have more importance than initial appears.  In fact I am surprised in my
rereading that the authors advocate the end-to-end tests to be done on
<em>deployed</em> systems - that is not something I’ve ever really tried and seems
very daunting.</p>

<p>The important things to remember here about the Walking Skeleton is that it is
<em>not</em> about writing real functionality, but meant to flush out issues both
technological and organizational. It will be definitely smaller than an MMF.
It might take a surprising amount of time to write it nonetheless. This is
because there will be a whole lot of learning happening. The same goes for the
first few features. (Boy is this a timely reminder for me right now…)</p>

<p>Unfortunately this slowness at the beginning of a project can seem like a bad
thing - but it is really not. The beginning feels a bit rocky - but then it
smooths out as deploy and integration issues have been resolved. In a ‘normal’
project the beginning might be smooth but the deploy and integration problems
will crop up and make the end rough.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-write-a-test">How to Write a Test</h2>

<p>The way they describe to write a test is something I try to do - but it bears
repeating (this is valid for tests at any level):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write the test you want to read (write helper code to make this possible).</li>
  <li>Watch it fail - keep working on it until it fails for the right reason
with a good error message).</li>
  <li>Now write the production code to make it pass.</li>
</ol>

<p>By taking the time to do this you will ensure that the goal and intent of the
part you are working on is clear. When done ensure it has a clear intention
revealing name - this is how you will understand the system later.</p>

<p>Start by writing an acceptance test for the feature. Write it in terms of the
domain and the user. An acceptance test gives feedback on the external API of
the system and upon major integration points both with external APIs and
internal components. Since the acceptance test is likely to be failing until
all parts of the code is written it will need to be separated from the main
build.</p>

<p>Once the acceptance test is well written then start moving down a level to the
objects that the acceptance test uses and unit test their functionality into
existence. This is the idea of testing from inputs to outputs.  Jumping to a
lower level object too soon will lead that object to have an interface which
does not reflect what it really needs to be. Only by building the objects
after building their callers can you know what is really needed.</p>

<p>The Authors have a bit of simple advice as to what to test first: they suggest
going for a simple successful path, and they make a good point why. Tests
provide feedback, if you focus your initial tests around error or edge cases
then your design feedback will be about that instead of the normal work of the
component you are writing.</p>

<p>One final important point the authors make on how to write tests is: “If an
area is hard to test don’t just ask <em>how can we test this?</em> but <em>why is it
hard to test?</em>. If something is hard to test it could be the tests are trying
to tell you something. This is one place I have trouble with - I seem to have
too much tolerance for pain while coding - a tolerance I need to cure myself
of.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-design-code-and-how-tests-affect-that">How to Design Code (and How Tests Affect That)</h2>

<p>Obviously writing tests before the code affects how the code is designed - the
pressures to keep each object isolated are very powerful. The book contains a
good set of design points which are not unique to the book and not new to me.
There were a few specific points I thought good to note.</p>

<p>When objects are composed together the interface for the composite object must
be less complex than the union of the interfaces of the composed objects. This
makes it a higher abstraction which hides some of the complexities. Higher
abstractions allow us to manage complexity.</p>

<p>Each object must be context independent <em>e.g.</em> everything it needs to do its
job needs to be passed into in via the constructor or the specific method in
question. Thus each object has external knowledge on a “need to know basis”.
This leads to the ability to recompose objects to get different behavior.</p>

<p>Create plenty of Value types. This combats Primitive Obsession and also
creates attractors for functionality.</p>

<p>Object peers (those objects which are communicated with directly) should be
mocked out in tests. This causes coupling and interface problems to be
evident.  Value types should not be mocked.  Neither should third party APIs
be mocked since the feedback provided cannot be used since the API cannot be
changed. Also mocking external APIs runs the danger of testing against
behavior you believe the API has, but may not actually have. Third party APIs
should be wrapped in a thin adapter layer which can be mocked in unit tests.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-types-come-from">Where do Types Come From?</h2>

<p>I rather like the Author’s descriptions of how types are ‘found’ when working
in the code. The three ways are valid for both Value and Object types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Breaking Out: When the code shows that an class is becoming too complex
that is a sign that it is doing too much.  Some of the functionality
could be split into helper types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Budding Off: When there is a new domain object a new type should be
created, even if is empty or contains only one piece of data.  The type
will act as an attractor for further data and behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bundling Up: When a group of classes are always used together they can be
bundled together.  Remember that composite objects should have a less
complex interface than their composed parts.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-final-note-about-mocking">A Final Note About Mocking</h2>

<p>I find that now that I can mock concrete classes in Java that I do not use
interfaces as heavily as I used to. The Authors specifically point out they
use interfaces quite a bit - again because they are concerned with
the communication between objects. I think this is one item I’ll keep an eye
on as work through the examples. I have used interfaces in this way before but
it seems lately I have not been doing so.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I agree with their design ideas. I already try to follow them. I am quite
excited to work through the example with them (something I did not do when I
read the book previously). I hope that by doing (and blogging about it) these
good ideas will sink in more; becoming more normal for me.</p>

<p>I also intend to blog more frequently on it instead of lumping large chunks
together like I did here.</p>
