The build is getting slower. It now takes 55-60 minutes for a full <br />rebuild - and not much slower for just a build. I wonder how slow <br />this build needs to get before other team members will be bothered by <br />it? <p />&nbsp;Of course we have already made a build target that lets you build <br />_without_ the unit tests and that is much faster (but more risky). <br />But that is just ducking the issue really. <p />&nbsp;We have built up quite a bit of debt in this regard. Everyone skips <br />around it saying that they don't have time to fix it - they have their <br />stories to work on etc. It is really feeling dishonest/dishonorable <br />to me when i do this lately. I guess it will be me that at least <br />makes a stink about it - if not just fix it.
