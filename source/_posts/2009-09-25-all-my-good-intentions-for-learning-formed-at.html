After having a great time at SCNA and Agile2009 and deciding that I <br />was really behind in my professional learning/development - all my <br />plans for sharpening my skills, learning a new language etc have been <br />put aside due to long work hours. <p /> It is definately not a sustainable pace; the end of this spurt is in <br />site. I won't need to, and won't be able to, keep this pace up for <br />much past Oct 1. <p /> In the end of November and December there will be again some long hard <br />hours as we get this product ready to ship. <p /> I am really feeling the loss of time for learning. I came away from <br />those conferences with a real sense of excitement an drive. I started <br />learning Ruby and that language itself was exciting to me. It all <br />started slipping away as I got busier at work.
