Why 'Team'? I feel that without a committed team all the other <br />practices will fall off - stories will be allowed to be not completed, <br />to be said to be done without being really *DONE*. Unit testing will <br />drop off, acceptance tests will be allowed to fail etc.. <p /> Why do I even wonder if there is /one/ central thing? When I first <br />learned this whole Agile thing I saw a diagram of the XP technical <br />practices and how they interrelated and it happen to show TDD in the <br />center. Since TDD was the thing that I really latched on to in the <br />beginning the diagram was great to me - it showed the centrality of <br />this important (to me) practice. Since then I've come to realize that <br />probably none of those technical practices are truly central - they <br />rely upon one another an can be replace with other (but not <br />necessarily as good) practices (i.e. code reviews for pair <br />programming). <p /> But I still have the thought that maybe some thing is mandatory - <br />without it Agile (in whatever flavor) is just not going to work. <p /> Last night at dinner after the Agile Bazaar mini-conference I brought <br />up this idea to Ron (whose last name escapes me currently - his <br />business card is at home) and he suggested it was Flow (from the Lean <br />camp). I think I can see his point; but I am still thinking it is <br />Team. Without a committed team how could you have good flow? <p /> Need to roll this around in my head a bit - and maybe bounce it off <br />some more smart people t see if there is any merit to this line of <br />thinking.
