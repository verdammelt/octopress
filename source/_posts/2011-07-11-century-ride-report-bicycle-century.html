<p>This is what a completed century looks like:
<img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6135/5924325779_8759bf2911_d.jpg" alt="DONE" /> Everything else are just details.</p>

<p>The dramatis personae of this story are: a 40 year old male:
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2699/4419808164_7710801f44_d.jpg" alt="myself" /> and a 39
year-old lady
<img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5231/5901903172_fb4fbe78b7_d.jpg" alt="Gale" /></p>

<p>The trip was approximately[1] the following <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Central+Square,+Cambridge,+MA+02139&amp;daddr=Salem,+MA+to:42.55182,-70.83646+to:Town+of+Manchester-by-the-Sea,+Manchester-by-the-Sea,+MA+to:Magnolia,+Gloucester,+MA+to:Gloucester,+MA+to:Rockport,+MA&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=42.54388,-70.87364&amp;spn=0.011066,0.022681&amp;sll=42.552132,-70.837462&amp;sspn=0.011065,0.022681&amp;geocode=FZlxhgIdFwjD-ynpwOBIUXfjiTFLx8G9sLwZUg%3BFfTLiAIdtDPG-ym3VvhqZGnjiTFFWaWlorjggQ%3BFQxKiQIdFB_H-yn72FRgbRbjiTHZHwtnQNugJw%3BFYKtiQIdqzrI-ynF6Iek4jzjiTGLmKUWhIum3w%3BFYufiQIduArJ-yk1ORclXjvjiTESuOi5ACYccw%3BFXhEigIdm8jJ-ykxAHOGgiTjiTHtwm8wq7fV6g%3BFaPfigIdXmvK-yk77KC7jSPjiTHxfw2gWoFWOQ&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrsp=2&amp;sz=16&amp;via=2&amp;dirflg=b&amp;z=16&amp;lci=bike">route</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that it ended up being a Century was a bit of a self-trick on
my part.  I planned on the trip to Salem and <em>maybe</em> further.  Of course
when i got to Salem I felt great (only 15-20 miles) so I went off to
Manchester-by-the-sea; and still felt great so off to Gloucester etc.
Thus after 50 miles I was standing on the train platform in Rockport
looking at the sign: <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6003/5924887054_1d3a343d06_d.jpg" alt="Inbound to Boston" />
and thinking &ndash; yes, time to head back.</p>

<p>Along the way I saw some lovely sea-sides, like the dock at Rockport
where Gale posed for me <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6138/5924886428_b7d0c5681b_d.jpg" alt="Gale at the water's edge" />
and Independence Beach in Beverly: <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/5924319663_7555c2667e_d.jpg" alt="Left Side" />
<img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6150/5924320097_6b037ccecc_d.jpg" alt="Right Side" />
Also somewhere, I passed this lovely marsh: <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6018/5924883828_043be25cbc_d.jpg" alt="a lovely marsh" /></p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t all lovely however, the roads were not always pleasant, the
hills steep, and the pilgrims unfriendly: <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6022/5924318777_86f9b256e4_d.jpg" alt="Conant disapproves of this frivolous travel on a Sunday!" /></p>

<p>Salem,
where I took my longest stop in either direction seemed to have only one
bike rack in the center of town <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5924887538_d82fa62e34_d.jpg" alt="The official Salem Bike Rack(tm)" />
The sad monuments in Gloucester made me remember the loved one I left
behind when I &ldquo;[went] down to the sea [by bike]&rdquo; <img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6127/5924884680_fe021859fb_d.jpg" alt="Loved ones left behind" />

<p>In the end it was a great trip.  The day was lovely and I managed not to back down from the challenge. I set myself a goal of riding a century this year and have done it.  It&rsquo;s very good to know that I <strong>can</strong> set myself a goal and carry it out.  I hope to take this knowledge and remind myself of it when I hit low points in my other goals/projects.</p>

<p>[1] (I say approximately since I took several wrong turns here and there (more like wrong straight-ons-when-should-have-turned-s) but that luckily found a slightly nicer track right when I got into Beverly by going on Lothrop Street which led me along the water.)</p>
