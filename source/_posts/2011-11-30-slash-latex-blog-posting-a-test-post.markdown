I have had some annoying problems recently making [posterous][posterous]
blog posts via [email][email] using [markdown][markdown].

These problems have made me feel foolish - like I can't get something
/simple/ right.  Or even more importantly, like I am incapable of simple
copy editing.

Thus I am writing this test blog post.

However, not wanting to write a post saying: 

 &gt; testing testing - please ignore

Instead I will mumble something about [LaTeX][latex] and muse on how it would be
sort of cool if I could write each post as a LaTeX document and then
they'd look pretty gorgeous.  Not that I need lots of equations - but
really LaTeX would do it so perfectly. ![isn't it
lovely](http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/creating_plots/latex_equations.png
"a lovely set of equations")

Perhaps my biggest problem is that I can't easily get a nice preview.  I
am editing this in [Emacs][emacs] using [Gnus][gnus].  Really given that
it is Emacs there may already be a solution to my problems - or I could
do it myself.

But getting back to LaTeX blogging.  What might that look like?  Perhaps
each post would be a [PDF][pdf]?  Or maybe the LaTeX document would be
rendered as [HTML][html]?  Perhaps this deserves a little more thinking.

Time to send this off and see how screwed up it looks in [my
posterous][myposterous].
