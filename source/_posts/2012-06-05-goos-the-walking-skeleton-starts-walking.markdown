Just a quick post to ensure I keep this moving along.

I have completed my review of Chapters 9-11 of GOOS.  These chapters cover the
starting of this example project -- the Auction Sniper.  There seemed to be
mostly ordinary stuff here (perhaps it is ordinary to me now that I have
worked in something like this style for a while...).

After discussing what the scope of the project is and some of the 3rd party
protocols we'll be dealing with we create a to do list of the initial
'stories'.  This will be our backlog.

We then start an Iteration Zero to get the Walking Skeleton up and running.
I've seen Iteration Zeros which didn't work - but I think the failure there
was not keeping them tightly timeboxed like any other iteration. The Author's
recommendation is to keep them timeboxed - so I have no complaints there.

One thing mentioned in this chapter as the first end-to-end test is created is
"programming by wishful thinking".  This is something that fits my style well
and I think I keep learning that if I don't do it; things don't end up as
nicely. Someday I'll learn to trust the instinct and style.

Finally in the final chapter of this little section we get the Walking
Skeleton going. The code isn't bad - there are some things I don't find
aesthetically pleasing - but I don't want to refactor too much - because if I
do it might be harder for me to follow along the future examples. Perhaps
after a bit more code is written I'll refactor on a branch. 

I think the major thing I'm learning is how happy I am not to be writing
straight Java all the time.  I write in Groovy mostly at work and Ruby and
Clojure at home. Straight Java is not horrible - but really there is so much
typing - it could all be done with less typing.

(Another reason to write this short post is to get rid of the mental block
that is keeping me from just jumping into the next chapters!)
