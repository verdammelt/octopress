<p>When I get the black Schwinn back from Harris I'm going to have to <br /> save up a few bucks to take this bike (blue BSA) to get its hub <br /> reworked. In the mean time I'll try to do the adjustment that the <br /> friendly mechanic at Harris suggested to me. <p />  This morning Wendy's bike (red Biria) was not sounding good. She had <br /> forgotten that it was making a clunking noise from the rear (maybe the <br /> gears, maybe the brakes?). We'll need to take that back to ATA (where <br /> it was bought - it is brand new) and have them look at it.</p>
