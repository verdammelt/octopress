Sure we had some communication problems back in the beginning, and we <br />still have some misunderstandings with respect to your feelings on <br />proper quoting rules; but I feel that over the years we have come to <br />have a very beneficial, profitable relationship. <p />&nbsp;I don't know how I would do much of my day-to-day work (both at work <br />and at home) without your little helpful utilities: find, sed, awk, <br />grep. <p />&nbsp;So once again - thank you.
