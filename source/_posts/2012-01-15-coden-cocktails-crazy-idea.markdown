I jokingly I mentioned the idea of Code'n'Cocktails on Twitter...

https://twitter.com/#!/verdammelt/status/158292007981289472

This was shortly after a short conversation while partaking of apr&eacute;s
[Boston Software Craftsmanship][bsc] beers in which I was asked about
cocktails and someone suggested getting cocktails after the meeting next time.
It was also immediately after I was asked when we were going to get cocktails
by [@zdsbs][zach] (prompted by my tweeting I had just purchased [a book of
Absinthe Cocktail recipes][recipes]).

I did but jest (*poison in jest; no offense i'the world* [Hamlet
III.ii.234-235])...

But now I am thinking it through.

I have heard of ['Code &amp; Coffee'][codencoffee]
and thought it a good idea.  A place to meet people who like code and coffee.
While I **really** like coffee, I also like cocktails and I seem to be
surrounded by people who get up later than I do - so why not meet *after* work
for cocktails and code?  *Brilliant!*

So what would a Code'n'Cocktail look like?  I see a few possibilities:

1. A cocktail party where code/coding is the topic of conversation
1. A coding dojo/coderetreat/code kata session with booze
1. A [*salon*][salon] for
   coding

I think the first and last are very similar and given my inclinations I like
the connotations of referring to it as a *salon*.  I think that would be my
preference.  I would not want to limit it entirely to discussion; so some
coding would be good.

What do I hope attendees would get out of such an event?  I think attendees
should have fun and at least one of: learn something, teach something, make
contacts.

This sort of event would have to happen at a bar or someone's home.  I don't
see how it could happen at someone's workplace or a place like [NERD][] as it
**obviously** needs a well stocked bar.  The problem is location.  The
Location would need to be able to accommodate an prior-to-event unknown number
of people (making a reservation would be difficult); and accommodate the
possibility of coding (standing at a bar may not work).  I think an off night
at a bar might work - the place would love to get business on a slow night...

The gears in my mind are turning.  If you have interest or thoughts please
comment or contact me.
