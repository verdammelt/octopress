I visited [Brick and Mortar][brick-n-mortar] before Thanksgiving for a Sazerac
and to let Lisa know that I'd be in on Monday with the
[Code-and-Cocktails][code-n-cocktail] group. She pointed to a cocktail on
their menu she thought I might like.  [Misty][misty] came over after my
Sazerac was done and I ordered it; since it had [Chartreuse][chartreuse] in it
I decided to ask her what the differences, if any, there were between Green
and Yellow Chartreuse. Turns out there are a bunch of differences and Misty
was quite happy to tell me about them. I asked if I could have a taste of each
to compare and she obliged.

I'm bad at describing tastes but I can say that Yellow Chartreuse is sweeter
and not as strong, the Green is a stronger Liqueur and not as sweet, more
herbal.

After this experiment I decided I needed to get some and add more drinks to my
home repertoire. After buying it I pinged Misty on twitter and asked for a
recommendation for a drink combining gin, or rye, or vermouth (my staples)
with the Chartreuse. She pointed me at the Bijou. The recipe she gave me was:
equal parts gin, chartreuse and sweet vermouth (I did 1oz), a dash of orange
bitters and lemon oil garnishing.

The taste was very complicated and very good. Chartreuse is something I am
going to continue to explore.
