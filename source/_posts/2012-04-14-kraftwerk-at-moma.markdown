We were going to see Kraftwerk at MoMA and the trip didn't start well as we
sat in stop-and-go traffic through Connecticut right into NYC. Luckily we were
not driving ourselves, but I still worried this was an ill omen. We even had
trouble finding some quick food before the show.  Even with all these problems
the show was fantastic.

Wendy and I staked our claim to a bench off to the side and at the back while
the surprisingly young crowd filled in in front of the stage.  The view was
just fine from where we were.

The show began with the dropping of the curtain - showing the band at their
podiums. 

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930628196/" title="Man Machine by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7256/6930628196_f0e9f55d7d_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Man Machine"></a></div>

They started the album off by playing Man-Machine and with the 3d glasses the
visuals were interesting...  but when Spacelab started they were fantastic.  

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/6930629942/" title="Spacelab by verdammelt, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7245/6930629942_d14e740db0_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="Spacelab"></a></div>

The images of Spacelab orbiting the earth was great. They even used a cheap 3d trick of having the
orbiting ship head straight into the audience; cheap but still fun.

The huge looming buildings, and slow pans through them fit with the song
Metropolis perfectly.

The visuals for The Model were all black-and-white fashion shots - not much
more interesting in '3d' than not, but the next song (Neon Lights) used the 3d
effects better.

The album performance was capped off with We are the Robots. Everyone went
wild over the robo-kraftwerk dancing and looming over the audience.

Now that the album was over I was not sure what to expect; I was not
disappointed with their choice of Autobahn - the visuals being computer
generated VW Beetle and other cars on a seemingly infinite Autobahn. The song
ended with VW pulling off the highway.

Up next was Radioactivity followed by Trans Europe Express. Then ComputerWorld
and Tour De France.

Then my phone battery died - so not more pictures. So you'll have to take my
word on it that the rest of the show, including Technopop was fantastic.
