My [Mother's][mama] Kartoffelsalat (Potato Salad) recipe is a German style
potato salad; not one with mayonnaise. This is the type I grew up with and I
think the other type is just *wrong*.

One day many years ago I asked my mother from the recipe and she gave it to
me. Trouble was - she didn't have any measurements. It was all done by how
much seemed good. I present the recipe to you in the same way.

- Potatoes. Boiled until they are cooked through - but not mushy. Cut up
  potatoes if some are much bigger than others (so they cook evenly). Then
  sliced into approx 1/4" slices. Peeling is optional.
- Oil
- Vinegar
- Salt & Pepper
- Onion - chopped
- Garlic - minced
- (optional) Bacon - cut into little pieces and cooked crisp.
- (optional) Cucumber - sliced very thin.

I usually make it with 5lbs of potatoes (because I am bringing it to
Thanksgiving dinner for example). For that much potato 1-2 onions will be good
and something like a tablespoon of garlic (hard to have too much for me).

After slicing the potatoes while still hot and adding garlic and onion put in
oil and vinegar - make sure the potatoes are well coated. I like it to be a
bit sour so I make sure there is a bit more vinegar than oil.  

Salt and pepper to taste.

Can be served warm after cooking or cold, or reheated in a microwave, or fried
up in a pan (Papa did that one time when Mama was in the hospital and I was
still pretty young).

Enjoy.
