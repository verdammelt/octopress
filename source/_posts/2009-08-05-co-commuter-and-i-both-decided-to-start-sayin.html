I've recognized that this guy is the same guy I pass every day for about <br />2 weeks; he goes out-bound and I go in-bound in the morning; vice versa <br />in the evening. I guess we have similar schedules. <p />&nbsp;The last week or so I decided I should be friendly and nod and smile as <br />we pass. This morning I decided that if we passed, I'd say 'hi'. After all we <br />know each other now after a week of nodding and smiling ("I'm a biker, <br />you're a biker, we're both bikers" type nod-n-smile). <p />&nbsp;Turns out he decided that today was also the day to say 'hi'. As we <br />passed we both pretty much simultaneously said 'good morning'. <p />&nbsp;Friendly coincidence.
