Hippocrates noted that there was so much to his craft to learn, but only such
a short life to learn it in[^hippo]. Chaucer paraphrased it as *'Life is so
short, and the craft takes so long to learn'*[^chaucer].

While I can totally relate to that idea these days I didn't always. At one
point I was a foolish person who thought they were good at what they did and
just slid along, month after month, year upon year not improving. That changed
several years ago when I was introduced to a bunch of new (to me) ideas and
techniques and the scales fell from my eyes and I realized how little I knew.

I feel I know so little sometimes; that my skills as a developer are limited.
I know that is not entirely true, my self-deprecation rearing its ugly head.
But it is a frequent feeling.

There *is* so much to learn and one's life *is* so short; why then should I
even bother? I enjoy programming, and I, as part of my character, prefer to do
the best job I can. Thus I am left with no choice but to do everything I can
to improve my skills.

There *is* so much to learn and one's life *is* so short; how then can I move
forward? I have been focusing on the basics (such as simple design and clean
code) - these will be skills applicable to any programming language I may use
or project I may be on. From this base I can expand into areas which are less
familiar to me (such as functional and logic programming) - these will broaden
the mind and help clarify existing skills in the familiar areas.
