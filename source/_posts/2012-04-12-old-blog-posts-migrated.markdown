Using [this][posterous.rb] updated migrator for [Jekyll][] I have managed to
get all my old Posterous blog posts loaded into this Octopress blog.

There is still a problem with some posts - the media they contained are not
currently available.  I think it was the posts where I had emailed a picture
to Posterous (which would then bounced to Flickr and Twitter).  But any post I
composed as an email seems to be here.

The time it takes to generate the site has really dropped off unfortunately.
Hopefully it will not just get linearly worse...
