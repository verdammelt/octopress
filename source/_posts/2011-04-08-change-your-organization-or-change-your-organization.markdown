Several years ago I was pointed to Martin Fowler's quote.
For the next few years I tried the first half of the quote. It was hard 
bit I didn't really have much luck. Sometimes I felt like giving up; 
quitting or worse - going with the flow. I sometimes wanted to let the 
people and company do what it wanted and let the chips fall - at least I 
would be able to say "I told you so".

Finally I decided to follow the second part of the quote; and that is 
what I've done. In some ways it feels a little like quitting or giving 
up. But trying to change the organization that doesn't want to change is 
very tiring.

I hope that the new organization will be a better fit for me.

Fit. I think that is the key. The company *was* a good fit for me, but not 
any more. We no longer fit; and so since I cannot work to change them, 
I'll do the changing.


Hope I'll get over feeling like I've failed.
