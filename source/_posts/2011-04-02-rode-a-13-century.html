<p>My goal today was to ride a &ldquo;marathon&rdquo; &ndash; but in the end I extended
myself to 1/3 century.  Given that I had some errands to run I just made
that the &ldquo;reason&rdquo; for my trip.  I rode Gale. <img title="My lovely steed" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3506/3181434926_a4748e5e20_d.jpg" alt="Gale" />  Gale is a 39 year old, many-10s of pounds 3
speed. She&rsquo;s awesome. </p>

<p>First to get fitted for a tux &ndash; that was easy &ndash; but I realized that my
bike computer wasn&rsquo;t zeroed out so I did that when I got to the mall &ndash;
so 2.5-3 miles is actually missing from the rest of this story.</p>

<p>Then to the vet &ndash; over the hills of Brookline &ndash; to get cat food.  Ugh
the hills killed my knees because I took them too aggressively.  The 8lb
bag made the bike a bit wobbly &ndash; but made it home OK.</p>

<p>Then I rode off to the office to load up both panniers with books from
the office &ndash; no reason to leave the books there anymore.  Two panniers
FULL of compsci books made the bike VERY wiggly, had to be very
careful. A protest in the common right where I get into it diverted me
around the common on the street &ndash; which gave me the opportunity to see
and say Hi to a coworker, Heather Kanser.</p>

<p>Now, home again, I had to go back out to get mileage.  I decided to head
to Fresh Pond and take a ride around.  Lovely ride but the clouds were
gathering and then the &ldquo;lovely&rdquo; spring rain started.  Cold but
refreshing.  The path around the reservoir was annoying &ndash; LOTS of dog
walking &ndash; will need to check if bicycles are even allowed on the path &ndash;
maybe not.</p>

<p>It was on the way back that I got to my first goal, a marathon of
riding: <img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5180/5583426508_674c3241d6_m_d.jpg" alt="A marathon of
riding" />
and I decided to push on to 1/3 century &ndash; but where to go? Why the
Squirrel Brand Company building: <img title="The place where delicious candy was developed" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5299/5582840175_54992eeb9a_d.jpg" alt="Squirrel Brand
Company" />.  Heading towards home
I realized I needed to pad my ride a bit more &ndash; so I just took a LONG
way home &ndash; and riding through a COLD rain &ndash; and then finally: <img title="Made it!" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5025/5582840443_237d7fa63d_m_d.jpg" alt="33.33
miles" />.</p>

<p>Got home a very short ride later and my final ride was just a bit over
1/3 century <img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5259/5583427320_111cfc35c7_m_d.jpg" alt="Final
Tally" />.
Average speed just over 10mph. </p>

<p>Other than my knees bothering me a bit (due to the overly aggressive
early riding) I&rsquo;m feeling good.  Going to go get some Chinese food!</p>

<p>LoseIt helpfully tells me that my ride burned 1424 calories.  Means I
can eat plenty of it without worry.  Yum.</p>
