While i thought the talk itself was interesting it was the chatting <br /> afterwards that really surprised me. <p />   First of all - i was social! <p />   Second of all - the discussion i had with Damon and Brian (from an Agile <br /> coaching company) really were pretty good. About the issues i am having <br /> with XP adoption etc. They really bolstered my mood again about <br /> sticking with it. <p />   I've signed up for the mailing list and i will see if my boss will ok to <br /> expense me going to the conference in November here at MIT.
