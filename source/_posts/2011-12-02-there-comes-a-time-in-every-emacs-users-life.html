<p>&hellip;you just need to nuke-and-pave your configuration.</p>

<p>That time has come for me &ndash; especially with respect to my <a href="http://gnus.org">GNUS</a>
configuration. I&rsquo;ve been using GNUS to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">news</a> since
probably 1990 or earlier, before then I remember using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rn_(newsreader)">rn</a>.</p>

<p>As for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email">email</a> I&rsquo;ve used <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Rmail">RMAIL</a> and <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryViewMail">VM</a>.  I don&rsquo;t
remember exactly when I switched GNUS but it has been probably at least
5 years.</p>

<p>Over that time my <a href="http://www.gnus.org/manual/gnus_11.html#SEC11">gnus init file</a> has grown pretty hairy.
It is time for a shave.</p>

<p>Over the last week I&rsquo;ve switched to a pretest release of Emacs v24 and
during that time I cleaned out a lot of configuration &ndash; but feared to clean out
much of my gnus configuration.  However in trying to get the spam checking
working better I realized that a nuke-and-pave is probably the best
thing to do now.</p>

<p>So I am about to remove nearly ALL of my gnus configuration.  Pray for me.</p>

<p>p.s. I&rsquo;ll try to blog about my luck or lack-there-of.  And also any
interesting bits I discover along the way.</p>
