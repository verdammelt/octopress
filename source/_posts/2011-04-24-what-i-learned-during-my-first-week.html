<p>The past week was my first week at the new job. I learned a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I learned how good pair programming can be. (But I worry I hogged the keyboard)</li>
<li>I learned a bunch of IntelliJ features/keystrokes.</li>
<li>I learned the beginnings of Java vs. Groovy.</li>
<li>I learned the power and the pain of &ldquo;magic&rdquo;.</li>
<li>I learned that working hard and going home at 5 without feeling guilty
is great (and also actually <em>taking</em> lunch too).</li>
<li>I learned that having lunch with the team is really nice.</li>
<li>I learned that there is such a thing as a good retro meeting</li>
<li>I learned that pairing is a great way to be productive on the first
day on the job.</li>
<li>I learned that knowing the programming language isn&rsquo;t really that
important at the start of the job.</li>
</ul>
