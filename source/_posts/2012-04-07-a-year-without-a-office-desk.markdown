(Well not quite true I don't have a desk at all... but effectively I don't
have one).

About a year ago I changed to a new job.  In all previous jobs I've had I had
a desk, in fact I had a office (sometimes shared) or at least a cube of my
own. It was different at the new job; when I showed up on my first day at the
new work there was a little bit of confusion about what cube I could be given
and as a 'temporary' solution I was given a desk in the lab.
