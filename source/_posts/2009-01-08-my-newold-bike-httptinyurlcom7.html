The Schwinn was left outside my house. I adopted it and when no one <br />came to claim it I started working on getting it ridable. First a white <br />chain for the Black bike seemed perfect. Then it got some lubrication <br />and new brakes along with the first attempt to fix the rear hub. The <br />first attempt didn't hold. Second gear slipped into neutral, a few <br />times in traffic (very scary) and there just wasn't any first gear at <br />all. Then I brought it to Broadway Bicycle school because they were a closer <br />shop that was said to be good with 3spd hubs. I had wanted to get it <br />overhauled by them but in the end decided to replace both wheels <br />instead. Definitely a big splurge on those; two new hand-built wheels. <br />The rear hub is now a 1990 (February) Sturmey Archer 3spd Hub. <p />&nbsp;I rode it home, a short trip, and it was fantastic! Can't wait to ride <br />it again (hopefully tomorrow - damn the cold!).
