It was not very easy to find - but that was primarily because I didn't <br /> have a map so I just wandered around the Longwood area on my bicycle <br /> until I finally stumbled upon Shattuck St. Then I finally realized <br /> that the building at the very end of the street is what I wanted. The <br /> Countway Library. <p />   On the fifth floor is the museum. Very small; just a few display <br /> cases; but the displays were fascinating in a morbid sort of way. <br /> There were old anatomical models - which were really dried body <br /> parts. The veins had been injected with wax so that they would be <br /> visible. A note said that the doctor would dry these body parts on <br /> his bedroom windowsill. Must have been quite the conversation piece <br /> when he brought the ladies over :). <p />   There were nasty implements of old medical science - huge forceps for <br /> extracting babies, quite LARGE items which the notes claimed where put <br /> in through the urethra. But making up for those scary items were the <br /> gorgeous surgery kits; ivory handles on green felt. <p />   I finally know just what it looks like when someone has Rickets (you <br /> definitely don't want it). The co-joined twins skeleton was <br /> fascinating - it looked like it must have been fake (one _hopes_ it <br /> was fake but it wasn't). <p />   Very interesting was the items about Phineas Gage. The actual tamping <br /> rod that had gone clear through his skull was sitting there in the <br /> case. <p />   Luckily I was blissfully unaware of the 'No Photography' signs until I <br /> had taken the pictures I wanted. <p />   (My pictures are at flickr: <br /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/verdammelt/sets/72157607217793573/)"><object height="375" width="500"> <param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fverdammelt%2Fsets%2F72157607217793573%2F%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fverdammelt%2Fsets%2F72157607217793573%2F&set_id=72157607217793573&jump_to=" /></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" /></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /></param><embed src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" allowFullScreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="375" flashvars="offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fverdammelt%2Fsets%2F72157607217793573%2F%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fverdammelt%2Fsets%2F72157607217793573%2F&set_id=72157607217793573&jump_to=" width="500"></embed></object></a>
