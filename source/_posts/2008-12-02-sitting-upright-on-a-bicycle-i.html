Because the Schwinn is kaput due to my amazing mechanical expertise <br />and i really wanted to ride my bike in today; I rode the Raleigh. <p />&nbsp;The Raleigh is a mid-90's generic hybrid bike. Straight bars, 21-ish <br />gears. I've put fenders and a rack on it at least. <p />&nbsp;It will do for now in the remaining good weather until i get one of <br />the more civilized 3spds fixed up. Then i can go back to sitting up <br />straight in the saddle, steering with relaxed hands instead of hunched <br />over leaning on my palms.
