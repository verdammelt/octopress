<p>That is what my coworker said, in his Russian-accented English.</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>&ldquo;The team is losing a&hellip; certain&hellip; character&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>He claims it was actually his wife that decided that I needed to be
presented with this.</p>

 Skull" /></p>

<p>What it <em>is</em> is a pot-scrubber holder in the shape of chromed skull. I
think I&rsquo;m going to make it into a candy holder in the new office.</p>
