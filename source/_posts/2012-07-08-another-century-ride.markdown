Yes, I am a very slow rider. I ride a 1971 Schwinn 3-speed. Deal with it.

## Places Seen, People Met
I traveled through a variety of cities:

* Boston
* Cambridge
* Arlington
* Bedford
* Concord
* Maynard
* Hudson
* Marlborough
* Southborough
* Hopkington
* Holliston
* Sherborn
* Natick
* Wellesley
* Weston
* Waltham
* Newton
* Watertown
* Maybe some more I didn't even know I was in.

I saw lovely tree-lined streets, I saw lovely tree-lined dirt-roads which
Google Maps says are bike trails, I saw empty suburban neighborhoods, I saw
strip-mall blight, I saw a wide variety.

I found out that while urban/suburban folk put out furniture with a 'Free'
sign; rural folk put out yellow squash with a 'Free' sign.

I saw part of Hopkington twice; but the nice guy on the 2nd story porch
pointed me in the right direction. I told him "Hopefully you won't see me
again" as I left, and he did not.

I stopped to tie my shoe and the homeowner working on his lawn asked to make
sure I had enough water - was going to get me ice-cold water if I wanted; then
we chatted about my bike and bikes he's had. 

I was only defeated by one hill: traveling south on Cedar St. to Hopkington
it appeared to me that the hill was about a 45 degree angle and maybe a half
mile long. After all the hills in Marlborough I decided to just walk up it.

I reached a personal-goal in the ride of riding across Interstate 495, I did
it twice; the second time was an overpass with no ramps was much nicer than
the first.

I managed to hit 30mph or come close a few times again; with a good road
surface that speed is much safer feeling. But one must be vigilant of any
possible bumps, and to be able to evade them takes a road clear of traffic.

## The Good, The Bad and the Ugly

It was good to go somewhere brand new to me, it was also good to have portions
of my ride be familiar; especially the end where after reaching Norumbega
Tower I knew exactly how to get home.

The bad was that I started the ride with a boring loop around the Charles and
then the very familiar ride out to Concord. I found that this stretch was the
most dis-spiriting; it was just a boring ride. The rest of my ride (except the
last leg home) was new roads I had never biked on (but I had driven a car on a
few it turns out). This was all exploration - that is what I need during such
a long ride.

The ugly? To put it delicately: my ass hurts.

## Would I do it again?

Of course I would - I'm just that sort of stupid.

I need to find places to go and things to see. I also need to make sure the
ride is as comfortable as possible.

Possible future rides (Century or not):
 
* To Providence with a stop in Franklin (to visit family)
* To the source of the Charles River
* To Seebrook Power Plant
