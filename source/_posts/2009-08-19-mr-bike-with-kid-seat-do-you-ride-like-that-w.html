Ran at least 3 red lights. With the red light at the corner of Essex <br />& Washington he not only ran the red light but then had to weave <br />around the cab that was legally doing a right on red from Washington <br />who had to stop for pedestrian's legally crossing Essex. He also <br />weaved around said pedestrians. <p />&nbsp;Less than a minute later the light changed and those of us waiting <br />started on down the road. <p />&nbsp;I imagined catching up to him and asking him if he drove better when <br />there was a kid in the seat - and if he did to ask him, as a fellow <br />road-user, to please start pretending that there was a kid in that <br />seat so that he didn't act like such a idiot/asshole.
