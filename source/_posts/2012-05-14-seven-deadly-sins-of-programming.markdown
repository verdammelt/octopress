At tonight's Boston Software Craftstmanship meetup I presented my lightning
talk: Seven Deadly Sins of Programming. It is a half baked idea - take it with
a grain of salt.

Attached are the [PDF slides][slides].

The source code for the presentation (done in the [Beamer][] package for
[LateX][latex]) is on [my github][github].
