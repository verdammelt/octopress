<p>So far I have flailed around moving my email to a different structure.
I have been using <code>nnmail-use-long-file-names</code> set to <code>t</code> up until now.
But I decided to try it out with the default value of <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>I had several problems this evening</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sent mail was going to <code>nnfolder+nnfolder</code> instead of
<code>nnfolder+archive</code> as advertised.  I think that this may have been
caused by old settings in my <code>.newsrc.eld</code>.  After mucking about in
there I started getting my sent mail in the right place.</p></li>
<li><p>Not sure how it happened but the system acted as if
<code>nnfolder-directory</code> was set to <code>~/News/nnfolder</code> but then suddenly
switched to <code>~/Mail/</code>.  I got that all sorted out (now set to
<code>~/News/mail</code>) but it took some time and my brain didn&rsquo;t figure out
how it was working for while.  The important part here is if you move
a mail file you must also move/edit the <code>active</code> file to list that
mail group.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Some of the problems may have been caused by a rather cavalier attitude
to the task.  If I had sat down to do it more carefully and slowly it
could have gone more smoothly.</p>

<p>No mail was lost so I am happy. But the system as it is currently
configured is definitely not the way I want to keep it.  Things to do
next:</p>

<ul>
<li>spam handling</li>
<li>expiry for archving (which I conflate that with sent mail processing)</li>
<li>splitting (but less splitting than I was doing previously)</li>
</ul>


<p>But now&hellip; time for sleep.</p>
