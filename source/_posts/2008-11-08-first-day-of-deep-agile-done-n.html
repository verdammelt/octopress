Well the first day of Deep Agile is over. <p />   I was hoping for more concrete discussion about How/Why Agile is 'Hard', <br /> about TDD pro/con. Instead it was some of that from "Uncle Bob" (which <br /> I've basically heard before), and some very abstract/philosophical <br /> discussion from Cope about what 'Architecture' /is/. Cope's talk was <br /> all well and good - but not what I expected and/or wanted at this point <br /> from this conference unfortunately. <p />   That is not to say that his points were bad/wrong/uninteresting. I'll <br /> have to take some time to digest and perhaps I'll get something out of <br /> this. <p />   We'll see what tomorrow holds.
