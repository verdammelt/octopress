Attended the Ig Nobel awards ceremony and it was amusing as last <br /> year. This year's theme was Redundancy! Several interesting <br /> pieces of research were awarded the prize including (but not limited <br /> to): <p />    * the mathematics of tangling string & hair <br />  * the use of Coca-Cola as a spermicide <br />  * the puzzle solving ability of Slime Molds <br />  * the relationship of tip earning and menstrual cycle of lap dancers <br />  * a study showing that high-priced fake medicines were more effective <br />   than low-priced fake medicine. <p />   The winner of the prize for the first one listed above actually sent a <br /> Tweet from the podium (and then apologized for being so rude). I <br /> bumped into him outside the hall to ask if he had _actually_ done that <br /> and he said he did - but i didn't quite catch his Twitter name - <br /> something like 'dorian'? <p />   In attendance was Benoit Mandelbrot (quite a celebrity!) along with <br /> the usual cast: the inventors of the Pink Flamingo lawn ornament, the <br /> doctor who found digital rectal stimulation cured incessant <br /> hiccupping, the sword swallowing doctor, and (my favorite) the guy who <br /> discovered the first known case of homosexual necrophilic behavior in <br /> the Mallard duck (unfortunately Harvard would not let him borrow the <br /> duck from their collection this year, as they had done in the past).
