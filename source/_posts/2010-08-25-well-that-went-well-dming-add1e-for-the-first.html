In my normal gaming group the usual suspects of who runs the games <br />didn't have any big ideas and/or were busy with real life to put the <br />work into a big story. So I took a risk and said I'd run a AD&D 1e <br />game, some module I had, just to keep the dice rolling. <p /> Well, my first session was tonight, the two main people in our gaming <br />group showed up and with their 4 characters total they met most of the <br />important people in the quaint Village of Hommlet. The players seemed <br />to enjoy themselves, and I did as well. <p /> I had too much fun over-acting several NPCs and also kept them on their <br />toes a bit when the young hobbit thief wanted to do some <br />extra-curricular activities the minute he entered town. <p /> Next session they will be heading to the moat house and we'll see how <br />well they will survive that. It would be smart of them to take on some <br />help, hirelings or just let some of the NPCs join them. But who to <br />trust?! Zert the smooth talking fighter? Turuko & his big, dumb friend <br />Kobort? Or maybe Elmo the fall down drunk son of the Captain of the <br />Guard? <p /> I know who they should and should not pick, and am pleased to see that <br />they may be making some poor decisions... its more fun that way :).
