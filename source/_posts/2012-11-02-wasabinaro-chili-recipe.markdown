The following is the recipe for "Washabinaros Chili", we found it on
[All Recipes](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/washabinaros-chili). It
serves 8.

The startling parts of the recipe which always attract people's
attention when I describe it is the wasabi paste, the beer and the
coffee. 

The recipe is not difficult but takes time. The prepping can take
20-30 minutes, and the total cooking time is 3 hours. However it is
worth the time.

## Ingredients ##

+ 4 tbl vegetable oil, divide
+ 2 onions, chopped
+ 4 cloves garlic, minced
+ 1 lb ground beef
+ 3/4 lb spicy Italian sausage, casing removed
+ 14.5 oz peeled/diced tomatoes with juice
+ 12 oz dark beer
+ 1 cup strong brewed coffee
+ 12 oz tomato paste
+ 14 oz beef broth
+ 1/4 cup chili powder
+ 1/4 cup brown sugar
+ 1 tbl ground cumin
+ 1 tsp dried oregano
+ 1 tsp ground coriander
+ 1 tsp cayenne pepper
+ 1 tsp salt
+ 1 tblspn wasabi paste
+ 45 oz kidney beans
+ 2 Anaheim chili peppers, chopped
+ 1 Serrano chili pepper, chopped
+ 1 Habenero pepper, sliced

## Instructions ##

1. Place 2 tblsp oil in large pot over medium heat
2. Cook & stir onions, garlic, beef & sausage until meats are tender
3. Pour in tomatoes, coffee, beer, tomato paste & broth
4. Season with chili powder, cumin, sugar, oregano, cayenne,
coriander, salt & wasabi.
5. Stir in 1/3 of the beans, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover &
simmer.
6. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the remaining oil.
7. Cook the chilies in the oil until just tender, 5-10 min.
8. Add peppers to pot and simmer 2 hours.
9. Add remaining beans & cook for additional 45 minutes.

## Notes ##

We use mostly Chipolte chili powder in this recipe, it really adds a
great taste and kick.

Also pick a good dark beer, a really 'chewy' stout. The last time I
made it I used
[Babayaga Stout by Pretty Things](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18371/54019
). Of course enjoy the rest of the bottle while cooking.
