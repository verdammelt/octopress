So you have a "Agile Board"(TM) congratulations! If you are like any
of the people I've worked with recently you've got lots of columns to
keep track of all the possible states a story card could be in. 

Back away from the board...

You should start with very few columns. I think four should be plenty:

* `Backlog`
* `Current`
* `Doing`
* `Done`

`Backlog` is the place to keep all your new ideas. Make sure the next
priorities are at the top and ready to go, as you go down the list
don't worry about the rest too much, they can stay vague.

`Current` is for the things you are planning on doing this
iteration. Use the Goldilocks principle. Don't agree to do too much
or too little. Just the Right(TM) amount.

`Doing` is for things that are being worked on *RIGHT NOW*. A good
number of items here is a function of the number of people on your
team and how they collaborate (pairing, mobbing, solo if you must). If
there are too few or too many items there is a problem - discuss
it. If something stays here for days that is the sign of a problem -
discuss it.

`Done` is for keeping track of the valuable things you are delivering
as a team. Rejoice. Throw them away after sufficient rejoicing
(sometime after the next iteration starts is a good time).

What about `Ready for QA`? or `Ready for Deploy`? you ask. I'd ask why
isn't QA and/or Deploy part of your definition of done?

What about `Blocked`. OK this one *might* be useful. But a red sticky
(or equivalent for non-physical boards) on the card is probably
enough. Moving it to another column makes it less visible, and a card
being blocked is a problem and we want problems to be visible.

Of course it is *your* process not mine. Use the columns *you*
need. But know *why* you need them, and feel free to add and remove
them if after discussion you realize the board is not serving *you*
anymore.
