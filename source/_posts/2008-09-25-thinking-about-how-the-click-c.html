Been riding the blue BSA (Birmingham Small Arms Co.) 3-speed a bit <br /> lately (even though it has decided that 2nd gear may disappear into <br /> neutral every-so-often, especially when in traffic! (but i tried the <br /> adjustment the helpful mechanic at Harris Cyclery suggested and it <br /> worked a bit, so I'll have to try it more carefully. I can probably <br /> get it working from the rest of the season and then bring it into the <br /> shop for a hub overhaul during the winter)). The click-click-click <br /> noise of the hub makes me smile; it cheers me up. <p />   Maybe I'm remembering being a little kid riding my first non-training <br /> wheeled bike with my mother. She'd be on her gold Columbia, basket in <br /> front and baskets on back, doing errands and I'd be pedaling along <br /> with her. We'd go across town to Aunt Alice (a vague relation of mine <br /> who was termed 'aunt'. My mother did grocery shopping for her, and <br /> when she finally passed on at 104 my mother was the executrix of her <br /> will. Thank you again Aunt Alice for leaving me the bookcase full of <br /> books (romance novels from the 1920's) and the oriental rugs. Her <br /> house was a cute little mansard-roofed 3 bedroom house just a little <br /> way from the center of Franklin, she always had Canadian mints in a <br /> bowl in the living room which she would offer me when we came over...) <br /> or we'd go uptown to the bank (where i had an account from before i <br /> can remember, i was always known as "Sofie's Son"). <p />   The click-click-click as i sit up, coasting along, looking at the <br /> trees, the ducks, the geese, the river, the joggers, the loungers, the <br /> other cyclists - this is a happy thing. <p />   Can't wait for the black Schwinn to be back from the shop (it was <br /> almost fixed but before i took it home the hub showed its true colors <br /> and would not shift well - so it is getting overhauled not just <br /> adjusted. Sturmey-Archer hubs are generally considered worth it. In <br /> theory if it is fix-able it will outlive me).
