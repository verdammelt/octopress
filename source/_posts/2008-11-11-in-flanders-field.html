In Flanders fields the poppies blow <br />   Between the crosses, row on row, <br />   That mark our place; and in the sky <br />   The larks, still bravely singing, fly <br />   Scarce heard amid the guns below. <p />     We are the dead. Short days ago <br />   We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, <br />   Loved, and were loved, and now we lie <br />   In Flanders fields. <p />     Take up our quarrel with the foe: <br />   To you from failing hands we throw <br />   The torch; be yours to hold it high. <br />   If ye break faith with us who die <br />   We shall not sleep, though poppies grow <br />   In Flanders fields. <br />   â€” Lt.-Col. John McCrae
