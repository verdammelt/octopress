Karl called me earlier to find out if I had an Arlo Guthrie CD. Unfortunatly we were already at the station. My brother's tradition is to play Alice's Restaurant each Thankgiving. <p />&nbsp;Hopefully lunch will be ok; it's crowded in that house now that my brother's family moved in. <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile
