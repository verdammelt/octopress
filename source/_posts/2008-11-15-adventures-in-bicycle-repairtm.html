The rear hub of the BSA has some serious issue. It really seems like <br /> the brake is engaged at all times. The pedals of the Schwinn were easily swapped - so it no longer has one <br /> bent pedal. Since the BSA is out of commission for now i swapped lights <br /> & reflectors. The rack couldn't go on due to the short bolts used for <br /> the fenders but i did put the basket on. Actually went to Cambridge <br /> Cycle and got a smaller basket because the one i had was The Biggest <br /> Basket Ever!(tm). Which is all well and good but not great for this <br /> bike. <p />   So - small repairs were accomplished - but there are bigger repairs that <br /> are still needed. Must find a local bike shop that can work on <br /> three-speed hubs - specifically Sturmey Archer.
