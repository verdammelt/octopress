Well that took me quite a long while to read; but this long weekend <br /> was just what was needed to finish it off. Quite enjoyable book. <p />   My records show that I put the book on my "To Read" list on Jan 21 <br /> 2005. It is now more than 3.5 years later. Also note that my reading <br /> list has 501 more books on it as of right now. It seems that either I <br /> must put less books on my reading list or learn to read faster. <p />   Obviously the only solution to this dilemma is to read faster. <p />   Next up (if i choose to read in FIFO order) is Mapping Human History <br /> by Olson & Gospel Fictions by Helms. Requested those from the <br /> Library. Now to find something to read while waiting for those books <br /> to arrive.
