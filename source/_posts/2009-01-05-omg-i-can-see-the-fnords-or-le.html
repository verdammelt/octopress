Getting off the Red Line in Harvard Sq. after work today i saw a small <br />sticker pasted over the writing that is just to the side of the doors. <br />The small sticker said simply "fnord". <p />&nbsp;Of course these stickers have existed for decades now i am sure. But <br />somehow, coincidentally, improbably, i have never seen one until just <br />now - a mere week(-ish) or so after i read The Illumanatus! Trilogy. <br />(No, i had never read the damn thing before... yeah, yeah i know i am <br />some 20+ years late on it... so sue me!). <p />&nbsp;I wish i had seen it earlier so i could have at least gotten a cellphone <br />picture of it. But of course what would it have looked like? A digital <br />photograph of a fnord?
