<p>(warning: an odd half-formed thought is contained herein[1])</p>

<ol>
<li>Yaweh let Adam name all the creatures in the world &ndash; this gave Adam
dominion over all the creatures.[2]</li>
<li>Medieval magicians believed that knowing the <em>name</em> of a thing would
give them power over that thing.[3]</li>
</ol>


<p>In software development we name things to keep tabs on them. To get a
handle on them. Without a name we can&rsquo;t refer to things &mdash; we can&rsquo;t move
things around &mdash; we can&rsquo;t organize them.</p>

<p>More importantly: to have the <strong>true name</strong> of a thing allows one to
have absolute control over it. Without the true name we don&rsquo;t have full
power.</p>

<p>Naming seems to be a special case of the power of language. With
language we have the power to communicate, to do things collaboratively.
Names let us do actions to things, and to collaborate on those actions.</p>

<p>Footnotes:</p>

<p>[1] In a discussion on Naming in the context of Software Craftsmanship I
made an odd statement linking naming in software with medieval magic and
the naming of all the creatures from the Judeo-Christian Genesis myth.
I thought I could expand it slightly here.</p>
