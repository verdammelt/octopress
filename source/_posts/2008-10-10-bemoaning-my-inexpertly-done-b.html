I fixed my rear flat tire last night on the blue BSA. Been a while <br /> since i repaired a rear tire without quick release skewers and first <br /> time doing it with a coaster brake. Took it for a spin and things <br /> seemed good - even seemed to have improved the gear situation. <p />   Part way to work however the gears started doing funny things and then <br /> i realized it was a LOT tougher to pedal. Turns out the wheel seems <br /> to have slipped a bit in the dropouts so now instead of being nicely <br /> straight: |, it is at an angle: /. I don't think the wheel itself is <br /> way out of true - it is just not sitting right. <p />   Revolution Bikes should have been the nearest place for me to go - <br /> near South Station. Took a walk there dragging the bike along... to <br /> find it closed. Called and got no answer. I wish i had called <br /> _first_!. <p />   So after work i'll walk a bit further to Community Bicycle on Tremont <br /> St. in hopes they will do the quick repair needed so i can get the <br /> bike home. <p />   Also hopefully tomorrow Harris will in fact have fixed the Black <br /> Schwinn so i can put aside the Blue BSA until i can get it repaired <br /> properly.
