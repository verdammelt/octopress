<p>Wendy and i were watching the speech when suddently the screen went <br /> staticy and then finally the Emergency Broadcast System broke in. <br /> What happened?! Was their a tornado!? Nuclear Attack?! <br /> Assassination?! <p />  No. Just a scheduled test of the system. <p />  WTF! <p />  Wendy was angrily switching channels and switching to NPR for audio at <br /> least. I sat back and started laughing - it was just too silly, a <br /> case of such bad timing and lack of foresight. I figured i'd just <br /> have to listen to it again on YouTube today. Luckily it only lasted a <br /> short time and we got back to the speech without missing much.</p>
