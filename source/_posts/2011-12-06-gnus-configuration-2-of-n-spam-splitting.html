<h2>Setting up Splitting</h2>

<p>The next thing I felt I needed to set up was spam splitting.  I didn&rsquo;t
want obvious spam being dumped into my inbox anymore.</p>

<p>To set up spam splitting you need to be using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy
Splitting</a>.  Then you add <code>(: spam-split)</code> to you fancy split
rules. At this point you have something like:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(setq nnmail-split-methods 'nnmail-split-fancy
         nnmail-split-fancy '(| (: spam-split)
                                &quot;mail.misc&quot;))</pre></div>
</div>


<p>You also have to call <code>spam-initialize</code> to make it start working.</p>

<p>/However/ one has to do a little more.  You have to specify which spam
back ends you want to use.  Since my <a href="http://theworld.com/">ISP</a> runs
<a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a> I chose to use
<code>spam-use-spamassassin-headers</code>.  Setting this to <code>t</code> makes the spam
package check for the <code>X-Spam-Status: YES</code> header.  (There are plenty of
choices so check out the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Spam-Back-Ends.html#Spam-Back-Ends">doc</a>)</p>

<h2>What didn&rsquo;t work quite right</h2>

<p>I also wanted to use <a href="http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/">Bogofilter</a> so that my local machine
could learn to identify stuff that my upstream Spamassassin did not.
However I&rsquo;m not sure if that is working correctly.  My Bogofilter
database file is still zero size.</p>

<p>To get a spam back end to process spam and ham when you are done reading
a group you need to add some group parameters.  So I set:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(setq gnus-parameters
       '((&quot;nnfolder.*&quot;
          (spam-contents gnus-group-spam-classification-ham)
          (spam-process (ham spam-use-bogofilter)))
         (&quot;spam.spam&quot;
          (spam-contents gnus-group-spam-classification-spam)
          (spam-process (spam spam-use-bogofilter)))
        ...</pre></div>
</div>


<p>But like I said that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be working.  I&rsquo;m probably just
missing something small that is mentioned in the documentation.</p>

<h2>What seems to be broken</h2>

<p>Before my nuke and pave (and upgrade to emacs v24) I was using
<a href="http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/">BBDB</a> as a whitelist.  So if you were not in my BBDB then you
went to spam.  However with v24 when I try to use BBDB I get an error
saying that <code>bbdb-search</code> is undefined.  It /is/ defined in
<code>bbdb-com.el</code> however so I am not sure what is wrong.  I&rsquo;m going to
investigate a bit more and post a question on <code>gmane.emacs.gnus.general</code>
and <code>gmane.emacs.gnus.user</code> (maybe also <code>gmane.emacs.bbdb.user</code>).</p>
