<p>In normal mythology the far past golden-age was an age when people were <br />stronger, more beautiful and intelligent than they are now. We have <br />diminished over time. <p /> With D&amp;D it is the opposite:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In 1974 D&amp;D heroes had +1 bonuses if they were lucky. You got d6 hit <br /> points and you were happy (pretty good for the magic user actually). <br /> Everything did d6 damage. Magic was smaller and rarer - there was no <br /> such thing as Magic Missile. Clerics didn't even get a spell until <br /> second level and getting to second level was hard! <p />  * In AD&amp;D they could get +3, or even the the amazing +3/+6 with 18/00 <br /> STR. Fighters got d10 hit points and it was amazing! Magic was more awesome, but still not everyone had it. <p />  * In 2nd edition characters got SKILLS! Clerics had powers <p />  * In 3rd edition characters had /FEATS/! It was like everyone got a <br /> bit of magic now! And people started talking about BUYING magic <br /> items - those things were for sale now in game worlds! <p />  * In 4th edition - this is the golden age. First level characters have <br /> double digit hip points and do massive damage. There are lots of <br /> 'magical' abilities for everyone. I'm sure the local beggars have <br /> some sort of daily begging powers or something. Everyone is studly <br /> and puissant. <p /> Thus D&amp;D is the opposite of mythology in a way. But also in a way I <br />think we may have still diminished a little along the way.</p>
