The characters, two from last time and two new ones went off the <br />moathouse (/FINALLY/). They hired Kobort & Turoko to come along. I <br />haven't decided just when/if those two will double cross the group, but <br />so far the time has not been right. <p /> They encountered the infamous Giant Frogs in front the moathouse. The <br />Giant Frogs which are well know to TPK plenty of groups did not roll too <br />well and there were no deaths. One halfling swallowed but managed to <br />get out, and couple people brought to near 0 HP. <p /> They quickly scampered back to town and I was kind and allowed the <br />Cleric from the player who could not make it to do some Cure Light <br />Wounds so they only lost a day in town. <p /> Again they went back, and again they took their sweet time doing <br />anything - but they found the Spider! or more like it found them and <br />started to gnaw on a halfling's head (same halfling as above). Finally <br />before getting killed itself it managed to sink is fangs into the Magic <br />User who succumbed to its poison. Poor magic user, never actually cast any spells in this game. <p /> So then back again to town, a smidge of loot dispersal and Players had <br />to go home early so we called it there. <p /> Fun was had. Dice were rolled. Monsters killed. It was successful.
