Build machine and file server off network due to two ports on the <br /> switch suddenly being dead. <br /> Services on Server did not start up correctly because its C: was full. <br />  Then it wouldn't boot well and it is in a locked server room on the <br /> 9th floor so i had to call someone to boot it for me. <p />   It's only 10:20. There is still plenty of Monday left to be <br /> fundamentally *Monday*. I hope however that this batch of Monday-ness <br /> is sufficient to meet my weekly quota of annoying Monday-crap so i can <br /> get on with my workday.
