Yesterday we had some layoffs - my project lost 4 people in Boston <br />alone, another 5 in our other offices. Layoffs happened across the <br />company. Then we found out that the project itself was also <br />cancelled. We'll be assigned to other projects but we don't know what <br />those will be yet. <p /> So nothing left to do but do a little polishing of the code, fixing a <br />couple bugs so that when the code is put on the shelf it is in <br />reasonable shape to be taken down for demos or even restarting <br />someday. <p /> At least i won't be needing to work long hours and weekends until the <br />end of the month!
