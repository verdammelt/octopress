There were 3 geese in the path as i approached slowly. I rang my bell <br />and they started to move away as i continued to approach. Two went <br />left toward the river; one right. I was slowed to a slow walking pace <br />as i got to the geese. That is when the right-hand goose decided to <br />become a left-hand goose. It dashed in front of me and i braked and <br />swerved - we collided and then it went squawking away. <p /> I do hope it is ok.
