Really, the bike lanes that you are painting are dangerous.  They are <br /> mostly right in the door zone! Are you trying to kill off the <br /> bicyclists that don't realize how dangerous that is?! <p />   If you want to help - start paving roads better (like Essex St. in <br /> Boston through Chinatown).
