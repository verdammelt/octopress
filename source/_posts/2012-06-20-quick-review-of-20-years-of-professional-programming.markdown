In May 1992 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from
[WPI][]. That means that I've been a '*professional*' programmer for a little
bit over 20 years.  I have to say that while on the whole it has been good I
regret some things.

Firstly, I think I got a good education from WPI.  However I wish I had taken
it onto myself to get a *better* education.  I didn't extend myself enough, I
didn't really dig into things as much as I could have. I got good grades and
left it at that.  This is a regret of mine.

Nextly, upon graduating, I got some jobs and things went well. I fell into
thinking that I knew what I was doing.  I think I was, while cocksure, still a
bit better than the average programmer of the time with equal experience.  But
it was during this approximately 10-15 year period where I fell into a lull. I
thought I was good and I never did too much extra-curricular research. I did
have a small piece of [free software][tnef] that I worked on during this time
- but that didn't really stretch my abilities. The work I was doing at work
  was good - but again not stretching my abilities.

During this time I only remember going to a single 'conference'. That was when
the local [ACM][] chapter in [Boston][gbcacm] brought in one of the 
[Gang of Four][gof] to talk about their book. I distinctly remember that during the
lunch I was so shy/awkward that I felt like never attending anything like this
again.

Sometime during the last 5-10 years I started to become dissatisfied with how
software projects were being run and how quality, my own and other developers
was being handled.  Sometime during this time period I was exposed to Agile
methodologies. Perhaps the time was just 'right', but for whatever reason
instead of just sitting around and accepting things I did a lot of research, I
started reading blogs, I started trying things out for myself, I even went to
conferences and made some good connections with people.

It was at this point I started to realized 1) how little I knew and 2) how
much I had forgotten.

This is where I am now. I am trying to turn myself around and learn more and
all the time.

I hope my next 20 years of programming (because I plan on coding (maybe not
always for pay) until I die) will not find myself falling into another rut...
