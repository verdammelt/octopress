On Saturday (2011-06-18) I set out for a 50 mile ride. I was going to <br />do my 'usual' loop[1] backwards (/e.g./ home -> Norumbega -> Walden -> <br />Concord -> Bedford -> Lexington -> Home (plus something more to fill in <br />extra mileage). It did not turn out as expected... <p /> For one, it was cuter than expected. I saw a total of 10 chipmunks[2] <br />(3 suicidal), 1 groundhog, a serene black-and-white cat sitting on a log <br />in the woods and 1 duck with bevy of ducklings paddling along in a <br />culvert. That along with the usual set of squirrels and birds made for <br />a high cute-level of the ride. <p /> Secondly the ride was longer than expected. I was 6-7 miles short when <br />I stopped off at home to refresh my water and make some. I decided to <br />take the loop around the Charles, boring, but would be easy enough - <br />even with the remnants of Bruins fans littering the ground. However <br />when 50 showed up on my odometer I decided to press on - I was feeling <br />pretty good[3]. In all I rode 62.39 miles. That put me just into the <br />100km territory - thus I have unlocked my next 'achievement': Metric <br />Century. <p /> One other oddity of this ride: tourists at the Norumbega tower. I was <br />sitting there at my first way-point sipping my coffee when they arrived <br />in two cars and came up and started reading the plaque. As I prepared <br />to leave I told them about the plaque at Mt. Auburn Hospital and the <br />Lief Erikson statue on the Commonwealth Mall. Then they asked what else <br />I knew about this odd guy - thus I became briefly a sort of tour-guide <br />for New England's bogus Viking heritage. I am annoyed with myself that <br />I never asked them what brought them to the tower however. <p /> Trip Statistics: <br /> * Miles: 62.39 <br /> * Riding Time: 5:38:44 <br /> * Total Time: (uh... more...) <br /> * Average Speed: ~11mph <p /> I am quite pleasantly surprised that even after such a long ride my <br />knees/legs/butt is doing pretty well. Right after the ride I was pretty <br />beat, and the next day as well my knees (especially the right) <br />complained about stairs. Now on the 2nd day after there seems to be no <br />problems and riding my bike today felt great. A hundred miles seems <br />very doable given time in the day. I'm going to do a few more 62 mile <br />runs and at least one 75 before I do my Century. I might be able to do <br />it as early as September which might make a great thing to do for my <br />birthday. <p /> Footnotes: [1] Here usual means the route I've taken twice before. <p /> [2] They must have been metric chipmunks since on average they appeared <br />1 per 10km <p /> [3] Of course about a mile later, one knee and the opposite calf <br />started complaining. Typical.
