Unfortunately i don't have any of my mail since before 2000. The <br />earliest mail i have currently is a short exchange i had with Richard <br />Stallman about a GPL question related to my tnef project <br />(tnef.sourceforge.net). <p />&nbsp;I wish i had earlier emails. I'll have to see if i have emails <br />elsewhere on my hard drive and then suck them into gnus so that i have <br />them all in one spot. <p />&nbsp;I wish i had started splitting my mail properly earlier in gnus - i had <br />to manually split a whole lot of already archived mail since i don't see <br />the need to archive all my mailing lists. <p />&nbsp;(of course all this work is in addition to the backup-style archiving <br />that GMail does for me...)
