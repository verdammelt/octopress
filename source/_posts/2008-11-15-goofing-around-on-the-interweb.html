The 'plan' for the day is to see if i can fix or at least diagnose the <br /> problem with the BSA. The last ride on Tuesday felt like the brake was <br /> always partially engaging. It might be beyond my skills but i can at <br /> least verify if that is the issue. Also i'll see if i can replace the <br /> pedal on the black Raleigh so that it is more ridable (even without all <br /> of its gears). <p />   We'll see how this works out.
