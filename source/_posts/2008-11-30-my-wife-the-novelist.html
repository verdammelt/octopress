Wendy completed her story yesterday early evening with 50,643 words. <br />She says she'll let me read it, i am honored. <p />&nbsp;Now if i could only go and complete some of my 'projects' like that. <br />One take-away of the <a href="www.naniwrimo.com">NaNiWriMo</a> is to <br />have a goal and a deadline. The goal should be a bit difficult but <br />doable. <p />&nbsp;I'll have to try to fit that into my projects. That might help me get <br />things done.
