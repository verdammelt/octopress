First the tire from the Schwinn is weird. It was really tough to get <br />off the wheel in the first place. Then it was nigh impossible to get <br />the new tire back on - in the process i screwed the tube because it <br />won't hold air. <p />&nbsp;At this point i switched to another wheel i had around. Tube & tire <br />went on that pretty easy. Putting it onto the bike was another matter. <br />Partially rounded at least one nut and did something funky to the front <br />hub itself - now it doesn't really want to turn. Something is tightened <br />too much and i don't have the patience to figure it out (that is if i <br />have the knowledge to figure it out - it might be beyond my meager <br />bicycle mechanics skills). <p />&nbsp;So starting with a bike that had wobbly/bumpy tires but could be ridden, <br />i have ended this evening up with a bike that can't be ridden at all. So if i want to ride to work tomorrow it will have to be on the Trek <br />as the BSA still has the wonky hub with the always on coaster brake. <br />But the Trek doesn't have lights anymore (i moved them onto the Schwinn <br />naturally) so that won't work unless i leave work early or swap the <br />lights early tomorrow morning. <p />&nbsp;Argh.
