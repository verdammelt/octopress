<p>I think I have no solved the problem of Bogofilter not running after
group exit.  I had my <code>spam-process</code> group parameter written wrong.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(spam-process ((spam spam-use-bogofilter)
        (ham spam-use-bogofilter)))</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Note that this is a <code>sexpr</code> of two elements, the second one being a
list.  I had it being a <code>sexpr</code> of three elements.</p>

<p>Oh the joy of silent failure.</p>

<p>I have also found mention of the <code>BBDB</code> problem on the mailing list &ndash; so
there is a possible fix there if I get a new copy of <code>spam.el</code> from the
repository or something like that.</p>
