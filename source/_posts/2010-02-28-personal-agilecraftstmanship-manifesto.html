<p>I write tests first, then code, to ensure the code does what I intend. <p /> I refactor mercilessly to ensure the code is as clean, expressive and <br />well designed as possible. The unit tests help me do this by keeping my <br />code doing what I intend for it to do. <p /> I automate my acceptance tests for the same reason I do unit tests - so <br />that when integrated my collection of code works as intended. <p /> I release my code frequently so that I get feedback from those giving me <br />my requirements; to ensure it does what they need it to do, and so the <br />priorities/requirements can change quickly. My automated tests allow me <br />to do this as smoothly as possible. <p /> I search out tools/techniques which help me find problems in my code, <br />and which help me write the correct code faster &amp; better. <p /> I strive to always learn, to always improve.</p>
