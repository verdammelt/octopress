Friends, Bostonians/Cantabridgians, Bicyclists - lend me your ears! <p />   You are a vehicle. You have the same rights and responsibilities as <br /> other vehicles on the roadways. <p />   Please follow the laws, let's start small - pick a traffic law and <br /> stick with it. Just one. Like maybe not riding the wrong way on the <br /> street. Or maybe stopping at red lights. Signaling your turns? <br /> That's an easy one - you don't even need to stop! <p />   Oh, and would you all please not ride so close to parked cars - you <br /> are making me worried. I keep fearing I'm going to see a dooring <br /> right in front of me.
