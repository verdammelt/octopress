This morning when i thought - "damn it is going to be raining hard - i <br />wont' ride my bike today" i realized i got a little down, a little <br />sad. So i reconsidered - got my windbreaker out (not waterproof - but <br />water "resistant") and rode in anyway. <p /> The rain hit me about 1/3 into the ride - but it never got very heavy <br />so i am only slightly damp. More sweaty than rain-wet. The <br />windbreaker keeps me very warm and it is unseasonably HOT out there. <p /> I may ditch on the ride home and pick my bike up from work over the <br />weekend because it might be REALLY raining then. But maybe not - <br />maybe i'll ride home in the rain and get really soaked - i can always <br />hop in the shower and put on dry clothes when i get home. <p /> I don't want to let the weather keep me from riding as much as it did <br />last year and the year before. I do still need to get some better <br />clothing for rain and cold. I am determined to ride as much as i can <br />and not just be a fair weather rider.
