<p>Tonight's session of the Boston Software Craftsmanship[1] meetup was about <br />playing with the Io language[2]. I didn't know anything about it before <br />it was announced as the topic for the next meeting. <p /> A couple weeks ago I started googling and trying to learn the language. <br />I tried finding a unit testing framework given my interest in TDD, but <br />didn't find anything (my lack of ability to search for anything was a <br />trend here). So I decide to try writing one on my own. Perhaps I was <br />remembering Kent Beck's example of this in his book[3]. <p /> Even with my lack of search skills I feel that I learned some <br />interesting things about the language. I think if I spent more than <br />one and a half hours at it, and if my searching had been useful, I could <br />have gotten farther. <p /> I think that I will make this a pattern for me. Right after "Hello <br />World" I'll play with a unit testing framework. <p /> At the session tonight we ended up ganging up on my little framework and <br />taking some of the next steps to improve it. It may not grow anymore - <br />but it has served its purpose. <p /> My basic unit test framework for the Io language can be found on <br />github[4]. (But Io does seem to have its own unit test framework built <br />in, but it is hard to find (.../libs/iovm/io/UnitTest.io). <br />It is built right into the VM, use it instead of mine please). <p />  <br />Footnotes: [1] <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/boston-software-craftsmanship">http://groups.google.com/group/boston-software-craftsmanship</a> <p /> [2] <a href="http://iolanguage.com">http://iolanguage.com</a> <p /> [3] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530">http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530</a> <p /> [4] <a href="https://github.com/verdammelt/iounit">https://github.com/verdammelt/iounit</a></p>
