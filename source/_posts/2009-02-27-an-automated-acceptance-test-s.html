Our regression test suite had a failure rate of about 15/300 tests. <br />This morning's run was 50/300 tests - it was obvious that the latest <br />checkins were the problem. Hopefully the rest of the team will also <br />see this. <p />&nbsp;The confounding problem is that one of the failures looks just like a <br />known intermittent failure - but it was happening at a rate of and now happened more like 15/300 or 20/300. Also some of them are <br />now _consistent_.
