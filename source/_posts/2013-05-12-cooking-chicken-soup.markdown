In the interest in breaking my current blogging writing block I'll record for
posterity my 'recipe' for chicken soup.

First you need to eat some chicken so you have bones. I usually get rotisserie
chickens for another recipe (Skillet Chicken Pot Pie) and then save the
bones in the freezer. I use two carcasses for this recipe.

So take the bones and entomb them in a big pot with some carrots, celery,
garlic and onion. Don't worry about chopping up the vegetables or even peeling
them - this step is making stock.

(The clever ones among you will note that I didn't tell you how much of these
things to put in. I am doing this in honor of my <a

Mother's Day.)

Now put in enough water to drown it all...

and bring it to a boil.

Let it boil for as long as you can stand to. You want it to get all the good
tastes out of the chicken bones and vegetables. I usually let it go for 2-4
hours and stir it occasionally. I don't let it boil down more than half-way
however.

At this point it should be filling up your house with a very
delicious aroma.

After boiling it down you need to strain out all the solid bits and throw them
away. I have not included a picture of this because it looks rather unpleasant
and might put you off the recipe. But take my word for it - this bit of
unpleasantness will be worth it.

What you have now is chicken stock. Do with it what you will!

I usually choose to turn right around and create soup. I now put in carrots,
celery, onion, garlic, maybe peas. These, since you will be eating them should
be peeled, cleaned, etc.

I usually, because I am lazy, add a pasta to this soup, but potato or rice
could be used instead.

Bon Appetit!
