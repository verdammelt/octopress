My legs are tired and my butt a bit sore (bike seats not the most <br />comfortable). Lost 1st gear on my black bike partway through so i <br />swapped to my blue bike and then ran an errand to the recycling center <br />before doing another loop around Charles. <p />&nbsp;Now to get cleaned up, fed and start baking bread!
