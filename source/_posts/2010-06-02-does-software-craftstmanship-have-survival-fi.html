<p>(Short comment on &quot;Convincing Others&#39; slide from Bob Martin&#39;s QCon 2010<br /> Keynote (~0:45:00 - 0:47:00 in the video<br /> (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Robert-C.-Martin-Bad-Code)">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Robert-C.-Martin-Bad-Code)</a>))</p> <p>Uncle Bob suggests that simply doing the best job you can, and sticking<br /> to your principles and disciplines can convince others that the<br /> craftsmanship approach is a better one.</p> <p>However that assumes that the Software Craftsmanship has a survival<br /> fitnesse greater than other approaches in your environment.</p> <p>If you are working in an environment where non-craftsmen are seen to be<br /> better (more features produced faster) than the craftsman (less features<br /> produced slower, but _better_) then no one will be convinced to change<br /> behavior. In such an environment there is no REASON to change - in fact<br /> changing would be detrimental.</p> <p>I currently fear that I work in such an environment.</p> <p>(I fully understand that this is a case of &#39;change your organization or<br /> change your organization&#39; (stress on the latter) - and I HAVE stuck with<br /> this position for too long given the conflict on values that seem to<br /> exist.)</p>
