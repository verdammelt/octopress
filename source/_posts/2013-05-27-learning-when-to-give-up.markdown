Sometimes I wonder what the important skills for a developer are.  I now
believe that one of the important ones (perhaps most important) is knowing
how/when to give up and start again. This contradicts another important
skill/trait for a developer to have: tenacity. But I think they are balancing
forces with giving up being slightly more important. Let me explain.

Often when working on a problem, it takes longer; is more complicated and
difficult than expected. At this point there are many files modified and it
looks like there are many more to modify; plenty of broken tests, maybe an
unknown quantity. There are two options: keep going, or give up.

This is the point I like to remind myself (and my coworkers) of Will Rogers
quote. Another thing I do is ask "Are we digging a tunnel, or a hole?" If we
think we are digging a tunnel then we can give ourself a time limit for
further digging; if it pays off -- great! otherwise we need to climb out of
the hole.

I used to believe, quite strongly, that tenacity was more important. To
persevere through the mountain of outstanding changes and get it done was
admirable.  I now believe that giving up is the better option. What changed my
mind? I now see more benefit in taking the knowledge acquired from the work
done and reapply it to the problem from a fresh start. Powering through the
situation is deciding at the current way is the only way; starting again is
deciding that there is a different way, with the knowledge that the current
way has giving you (which is at least that the current way isn't working out).

As a footnote I want to add that I also thinking giving up in another way is
important. When working on something collaboratively (such as when pairing)
one can find oneself at odds with another developer about how to proceed. I
believe that unless the idea is very obviously bad that to stop
arguing/discussing and do *something* is better that spending time discussing.
Especially when there is source code involved - any code is better than no
code. Any code, can then be changed into better code.
