Looking at what was written i see plenty of TDD (or at least plenty of <br />unit testing) which leverages the ability to refactor; and leverages the <br />ability to make changes quickly and thus be quicker to deliver those <br />changes. <p />&nbsp;I also see plenty about simple design vs. big up-front design. <p />&nbsp;Why didn't this stuff get into my head when i first read this book? <br />Nowadays I'm all over this "agile" stuff. <p />&nbsp;Also i feel like i do OO pretty poorly. I need to work or that more - <br />to be more proficient at it. I guess i am just much more of a <br />declarative/imperative sort of programmer at present (even after all <br />this time working in OO languages).
