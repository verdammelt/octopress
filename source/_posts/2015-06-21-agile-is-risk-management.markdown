In a note of the References section of "Waltzing with Bears" (DeMarco
& Lister 2003), there is a note on "Planning Extreme Programming"
(Beck & Fowler 2001) which says "When viewed as a set of
[Risk Management] strategies, XP makes all kinds of sense." This made
me review how XP (or Agile more generally) is a risk management
technique.

The incremental approach of XP reduces risk of late delivery or wrong
delivery. The demo, planning and retrospective meetings seem to be an
implicit risk analysis/mitigation exercise. It might be beneficial to
make this more explicit.

One place where XP doesn't line up with DeMarco & Lister's thoughts on
risk management is their advice that there should be sizable up-front
design and estimation. XP eschews this. XP argues that the cost of
up-front design & estimation of higher than the risk that they
mitigate. It seems a reasonable risk vs. cost choice. Adding some
explicit up-front brainstorming should be sufficient to cover the
problem of missing large-impact risks. Furthermore the iterative
nature of the methodology allows for a just-in-time approach to the
costs and risks.

The book also contains a quote from Tom Glib who said (paraphrased)
'Be ready to pack up whatever you've got any given morning and
deliver it by close of day'. This is very fitting with the idea in XP
that the result of every iteration should be deliverable and producing
value. While a one-day iteration, as implied in the quote, is perhaps
too extreme for many teams; the exercise of determining what it would
take to deliver value in shorter and shorter iterations is valuable.
