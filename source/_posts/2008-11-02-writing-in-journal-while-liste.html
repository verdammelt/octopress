It is National Novel Writing Month (<a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">www.nanowrimo.org</a>) and while Wendy <br /> has decided to do that it is not something that i am interested in. <p />   However i have chosen to do something writing wise every day. I will <br /> write in my Journal every day. Along with that i'll be trying to update <br /> Twitter/Posterous every day as well. (I missed out on the first day of <br /> this self-goal due to a really nasty headache last night and i had <br /> stupidly left the journal writing until the evening... i have learned <br /> that lesson). <p />   (Hmm there seems to be a National Blog Posting Month <br /> (<a href="http://www.nablopomo.ning.com">www.nablopomo.ning.com</a>). I'll look into that.) <p />   Our week off in honor of our anniversary was good, but at the same time <br /> disappointing. First i came down with a cold on Saturday and then Wendy <br /> caught if from me. So we were both sick, but we were together. That <br /> was the important thing. We can have a anniversary dinner sometime in <br /> the next week when we are both feeling better.
