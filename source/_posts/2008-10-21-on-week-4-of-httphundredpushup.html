I didn't start off doing it very seriously so I ended up restarting it 4 <br /> weeks ago. Things went better this second time around (the first time I <br /> kept repeating week 2 since I couldn't manage the minimum 16 push-ups for <br /> week 3). Perhaps I should look at that first attempt as a prologue. It <br /> built up a bit of strength in my arms so I could do better this second <br /> time. <p />   However, that being said, it is still kicking my sorry flabby ass. <p />   *ouchy*
