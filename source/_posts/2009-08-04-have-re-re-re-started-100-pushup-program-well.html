In the past I kept getting stuck with no progress after a few weeks. <br />I'm willing to give it another try to change these wet-noodles I have <br />for arms into something more normal. <p />&nbsp;So I did the first day of the first week of the program on Sunday and <br />completed 14 pushups total. <p />&nbsp;Like I said in the title: "We'll see how this goes."
