(It was noted to me that for a blog called 'code and cocktails' that I
don't have many cocktail related posts - so here we go:)

I decided to try a new-to-me cocktail tonight and asked
[cocktaildb][] for cocktails which contain grapefruit and gin.  It suggested,
amongst others, the [Palm Beach Special][recipe].

I enjoy the combination of gin and grapefruit in this drink but I have two
issues with it which I'd like to experiment with:

1. I think it is too heavy on the gin - I think it overloads the grapefruit.
1. I wonder if something like St. Germaine might be a good exchange for sweet
   vermouth - obviously it would change the drink - but I think it might be
   for the better.

As an aside: cocktaildb is a great resource - I wish I could filter out drinks
for which I don't have ingredients however.  That is why I am building
(slowly) my own cocktail recipe website [`(defdrink)`][defdrink]. (The primary
purpose of `(defdrink)` is to be a vehicle for me to learn [Clojure][])
