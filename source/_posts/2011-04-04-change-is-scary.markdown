Today I did something that was hard for me - something I haven't done 
for a decade - I quit my job and accepted another one. It hasn't been a 
decade because my current job was so great, as people who I have talked 
with over the last couple years know, but because I was scared.
Change is not easy for me - especially change which seems big to me - 
like changing my job. I pay my mortgage with that paycheck after all, 
thus I put a lot of importance upon it, probably too much.

But now change is happening. My new position may not be my "dream job", 
I don't even know what that might be frankly, but I think it has a good 
chance of being a better job. I'll be working with some great people 
and I am sure I'll learn a lot.

I'll be put in the position where people are going to expect I'll know a 
lot of things - and I'm simply not going to. I'm going to try to deal 
with those situations, when they arise, without running away screaming.

This change has been long overdue, but I am finally taking it.

Here's to change.
