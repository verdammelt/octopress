<p>An addendum to follow up on how to fix an item that was giving me a
problem before.</p>

<p>In order to get ham &amp; spam moved and processed as such when you mark it
you need to set up additional group parameters:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>'((&quot;nnfolder.*&quot;
 (spam-contents gnus-group-spam-classification-ham)
 (spam-process (ham spam-use-bogofilter)
           (spam spam-use-bogofilter))
 (spam-process-destination &quot;nnfolder:spam.spam&quot;))
(&quot;spam.spam&quot;
 (spam-contents gnus-group-spam-classification-spam)
 (spam-process (spam spam-use-bogofilter)
           (ham spam-use-bogofilter))
 (ham-process-destination &quot;nnfolder:mail.misc&quot;))</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Specifically the <code>spam-process-destination</code> and
<code>ham-process-destination</code> pair.  These cause the mail to be moved from
the ham to spam groups and /visa versa/.</p>

<p>One problem still remains &ndash; the bogofilter still doesn&rsquo;t seem to be
doing anything.  I don&rsquo;t see any evidence that it is being called in the
`<em>Messages</em> buffer either.</p>

<p>So the score is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bogofilter not being called when groups exited</li>
<li>Wish I could get BBDB to work.</li>
</ol>
