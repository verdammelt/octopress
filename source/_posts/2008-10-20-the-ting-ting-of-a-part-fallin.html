Luckily it seems to only been a bolt that holds the rack to the seat stays. <p />   Very chilly ride this morning. First really cold morning of the <br /> season. Even so i still managed to build up a bit of a sweat. I ride <br /> too fast and dress too warmly. <p />   Wendy picked up her bike from the shop yesterday and it was good to go <br /> for a ride with her again. Unfortunately she opted out from the <br /> commute this morning given the really cold temps.
