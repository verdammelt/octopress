We heard a strange bird call when we stepped out of the house and then <br />we saw the hawk. Very beautiful. But we couldn't see the bird that <br />was answering the hawk's calls until later. We saw the squirrel at <br />about the same time it saw the hawk. Zoom! <p />&nbsp;Then we saw the second hawk - they were a pair. Finally they flew off <br />the east toward the train tracks and MIT, deeper into Cambridgeport.
