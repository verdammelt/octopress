It is tasty - just not soup. Wendy and i figured out what went wrong. <br />I figured out how much soup stock i had and from that figured out how <br />much rice i wanted to put in. Unfortunately my brain was working on the <br />formula for cooking rice, not for putting rice into soup. <p />&nbsp;So now I have many cups of chicken flavored rice with peas and onion. I <br />don't think it will go to waste.
