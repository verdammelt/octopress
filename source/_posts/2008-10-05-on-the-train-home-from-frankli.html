Brought the old BSA with me on this familial visit and it seems to be alergic to the suburban roads. <p />   Now ill have to walk home from South Station or catch a cab. <p />   Oh! A better idea! Redline to Central. <p />   Family is doing well; Papa with the second knee replacement doing well; brother with the nasty broken elbow doing ok too (as well as he can be). <p />   Little Erik proudly showed me his bike! If he like to ride bikes he can't be all bad :) <p />    <br /> Sent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile
