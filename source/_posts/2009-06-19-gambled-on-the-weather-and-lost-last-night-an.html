The mist got heavier as I left Wendy and the bus stop then turned to <br />light rain while heading toward MIT. This tapered off and finally <br />stopped by the time I was in Back Bay and I even started to dry off <br />near Chinatown (except for the small splash I got from a passing car - <br />damn!). Then as I neared the office, right as i got to Congress St <br />the light rain appeared again and i couldn't get my rain jacket on or <br />zipped in time not to get back to damp. <p />&nbsp;But at least it wasn't cold.
