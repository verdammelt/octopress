The Black Schwinn is working out well even without first gear. However <br /> there is some sort of shimmy in the front or rear wheel and the saddle & <br /> stem are too low. Raised those some and will have to look into the <br /> shimmy. <p />   The ride down the Esplanade was lovely; but very very windy. Coming <br /> back with the wind in our faces we decided to walk some - i think it was <br /> faster. I knew we were riding slowly when a jogger passed us. <p />   This afternoon's plan: reading Dark Heresy rules, laundry, other reading <br /> and maybe some programming (Project Euler probably). Wendy will be <br /> writing her novel. When she reaches her goal for the weekend she can <br /> sit down and read the book she bought - but not before!
