<p>I kept wanting to say something to the effect: "But no... you gotta make <br />the code clean..." (and I probably pretty much DID say that several <br />times).[1] <p /> But the point Naresh[2] made is valid: Spending lots of time on making sure <br />your code is clean may not be the best/most profitable way to spend your <br />time. <p /> I think a good way to summarize his point is: "If you have a good team <br />(which you trust), with smart people and tight collaboration with <br />customers, then the code is not important and will take care if itself". <br />He suggests an approach of building apps/features quickly (and perhaps <br />not entirely cleanly) so that you can get feedback from customers <br />quickly to determine if it is worth spending more time on it. This <br />makes sense - and if the app/feature is worth it you go back and make it <br />better. But if it is not worth it - you don't bother; it would be a <br />waste of time/money. <p /> The important issue here is what 'good enough' means. Naresh says that <br />you make this app/feature 'good enough'. He gives two different <br />examples: 1) a feature that they put together quickly and the <br />customer didn't care about so nothing more was done and 2) an app which <br />is being slowly and carefully crafted because the initial release needs <br />to be awesome. Both are "good enough" but "good enough" is very <br />different in each case. <p /> If the team doesn't agree on what "good enough" means then you have <br />problem there. Which brings up that this idea that the code will take <br />care of itself seems to be predicated on the fact you have a great team <br />with high customer collaboration. <p /> So what if you don't? <p /> Naresh answered this by asking if pushing strict TDD or Clean Code (TM) <br />was a good way to fix that situation. I can't say it is[3]. Education <br />seems to be the best thing. <p /> Educating my coworkers is something I realize I need to do - but I am <br />not sure how to go about doing it. We don't pair program - so I can't <br />directly "show". I need to find a way to do this. <p /> ----- <p /> Footnotes:</p>
<p>[1] I feel that my disagreements with Naresh's points are not entirely <br />logical and are based around my current lack of trust (and opinion <br />mismatch) with my current team. I agree that his approach is pragmatic - <br />I worry that 'pragmatism' can be the cover for lots of dumb stuff which <br />cause pain in the end. Again this goes back to a trust in the team - I <br />do not currently have trust in my current team and that is coloring my <br />opinion of how I think his suggestions could work. For them to work in <br />my current situation would involve a large change, not only of myself, <br />but of the organization and its members - which I don't think is likely <br />to happen (but is this opinion too just because I do not trust the <br />team?). <p /> [2] @nashjain <p /> [3] Although as Zach[4] pointed out: in my current situation, doing TDD <br />and making the code Clean(TM) is sort of a defensive strategy for me. <p /> [4] @zdsbs</p>
