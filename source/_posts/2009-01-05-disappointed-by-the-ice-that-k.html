It was a skating rink all the way up to Central Square. Luckily we <br />caught a bus a few blocks from the house. <p />&nbsp;I was hoping that today would be my first bike commute of the New <br />Year. I want to ride much more this year so i can't use cold weather <br />as an excuse. <p />&nbsp;Definitely once i get the black bike back from the shop (with its new <br />hubs and wheels) i'll bike all the time (Wendy told me that if i don't <br />after spending that much money on it she'll kick my ass :) ) <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />p.s. i did see my neighbor Guy leave with his bicycle this morning - <br />but he only has 1-2 miles to go to Harvard - he could walk it and then <br />ride his bike home this evening. Lucky him.
