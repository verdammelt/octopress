I think the idea of this Bug Fix Weekend is plenty broken. I'd like <br /> to think that the large bug count which prompted my uberboss to call <br /> for this monstrosity and ask for 'volunteers' is largely not of _my_ <br /> creation. <p />   But yet, here i am. *sigh* <p />   At least it is a miserable rainy Saturday - so i won't feel like i'm <br /> missing a good day. <p />   I hope other team members learn from this - this is a punishment <br /> because we are not doing our job. We are calling stories 'done' when <br /> they clearly aren't, we are allowing regression tests to break and not <br /> be fixed, we are focusing on doing more stories than fixing bugs that <br /> QA report. <p />   We have no one to blame but ourselves. <p />   Time to roll up the sleeves and dig in.
